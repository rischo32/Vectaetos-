# VECTAETOS — EPISTEMIC CRYPTOGRAPHY FORMALISM (v0.2)

## Status
CANONICAL EXTENSION — AUDIT LAYER ONLY  
Non-interventional. Non-prescriptive. Structurally descriptive.

This document formalizes the mathematical foundation of Epistemic Cryptography
as an audit layer over Φ.  
It does not modify Φ.  
It does not modify Vortex.  
It does not intervene in projections.

---

# 1. Ontological Position

Epistemic Cryptography does not protect data.  
It protects structural coherence.

It signs:
- uncertainty distribution
- asymmetry structure
- temporal layering

It does not:
- optimize
- evaluate
- block
- decide
- interpret

---

# 2. Field Structure

Let:

- Σ = {Σ₁ … Σ₈} — axiomatic singularities (fixed)
- P(t) = {p₁(t) … p₈(t)} — pole states at time t
- Each pole:

pᵢ(t) = (Eᵢ, Cᵢ, Tᵢ, Mᵢ, Sᵢ)

Σᵢ are invariant anchors.
Only state values evolve.

---

# 3. Local Epistemic Uncertainty

For each pole:

μᵢ(t) = |Tᵢ − mean(Tⱼ≠ᵢ)| + (1 − Cᵢ)

Total uncertainty:

μ_total(t) = Σᵢ μᵢ(t)

μᵢ ≥ 0  
μ_total ≥ 0

---

# 4. Pairwise Structural Asymmetry (28 pairs)

For each unordered pair i < j:

Aᵢⱼ(t) = |Tᵢ − Tⱼ| · ((Cᵢ + Cⱼ) / 2)

Total asymmetry:

A_total(t) = Σ_{i<j} Aᵢⱼ(t)

Properties:
- symmetric in magnitude
- non-negative
- no directional authority implied
- no hierarchy introduced

---

# 5. Topological Humility Ratio

h(t) = μ_total(t) / (μ_total(t) + A_total(t))

If denominator = 0:
h(t) = 1

Properties:
0 ≤ h(t) ≤ 1

Interpretation:
- high h → distributed uncertainty
- low h → structural asymmetry dominance

h is descriptive.
It is not a success metric.
It does not trigger intervention.

---

# 6. Letokruhy Time Layers (LTL)

Define time-layered structure:

L_k = (
    μ_total(k),
    A_total(k),
    h(k),
    QE(k),
    τ_k
)

Where:
- k = discrete time index
- τ_k = timestamp
- QE(k) ∈ {0,1}

LTL stores curvature of uncertainty in time.
It does not modify the field.

---

# 7. QE Condition (Topological)

QE may be recorded when:

1) Pairwise asymmetry graph loses connectivity
2) h(t) → 0
3) Structural discontinuity between layers

QE does not halt projection.
QE is descriptive state only.

---

# 8. Structural Properties

The system guarantees:

I. Singularities invariant  
Σᵢ = const

II. No feedback loop  
Epistemic Cryptography does not alter Φ

III. Bounded humility  
h ∈ [0,1]

IV. Non-prescriptive structure  
No optimization function exists.

---

# 9. Separation from Vortex

Vortex:
- generates candidate trajectories
- does not access LTL memory
- does not read h
- does not modify audit layer

Epistemic Cryptography:
- reads structural state
- computes signature
- stores layer
- never feeds back

Strict separation maintained.

---

# 10. Epistemic Signature Compatibility

This formalism supports:

- Epistemic Signature (ES)
- Coherence Checksum (CCS)
- h_flag (descriptive)

Signature binds structure, not decision.

---

# 11. Core Principle

Epistemic Cryptography does not preserve truth.  
It preserves the geometry of uncertainty.

---
