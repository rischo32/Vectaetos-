## VECTAETOS — Epistemic Layers & Streams

**Status:** Canonical  
**Immutability:** Meaning fixed  
**Scope:** Definition of non-agent epistemic layers and internal streams  
**Ontology:** Descriptive, non-prescriptive, non-operational

---

## 0. Ontological framing

These layers and streams are **not modules**.  
They are **epistemic manifestations of Φ**, observable as structure, not executable as logic.

They:
- do not decide
- do not act
- do not intervene
- do not optimize
- do not issue judgments

They exist to **preserve coherence, trace meaning, and expose limits**.

---

## 1. Layer vs Stream — precise distinction

- **Layer**: a *structural stratum* of Φ  
  (what exists simultaneously)

- **Stream**: a *directional trace* through Φ  
  (how something unfolds without agency)

No layer controls a stream.  
No stream modifies a layer.

---

## 2. INS — Inner Narrative Stream

**Type:** Stream  
**Meaning:** Internal epistemic auditor of linguistic translation

INS is **not intent neutralization**.  
INS is **not user-facing**.  
INS is **not memory**.

INS exists **between Φ and the LLM adapter**.

### Function
INS monitors whether linguistic projection:
- preserves semantic fidelity
- does not hallucinate authority
- does not invent causality
- does not introduce prescriptive tone

INS compares:
- runic / symbolic projection  
vs.  
- generated natural language

If divergence occurs:
- projection is attenuated
- output may collapse to QE
- or enter silence

INS **cannot write outputs**.  
INS **cannot correct content**.  
It can only **invalidate representability**.

## 3. LTL — Letokruhy Time Layers

**Type:** Layer  
**Meaning:** Non-linear temporal stratification of Φ

Time in VECTAETOS is **not an axis**.

LTL models time as:
- concentric layers
- irreversible accretion
- contextual thickening

Each layer:
- references prior layers
- never overwrites them
- does not imply causality

Parallel branches may exist, but:
- no branch has authority
- no rollback is possible

LTL supports:
- auditability
- historical coherence
- non-linear epistemic memory

---

## 4. ESM — Epistemic State Memory

**Type:** Layer  
**Meaning:** Resonant memory of significant field states

ESM is **not an archive**.

It retains only states that:
- altered coherence
- produced aporia
- shifted epistemic topology

It forgets:
- neutral interactions
- repetitive noise
- non-transformative queries

Memory here is **meaning-weighted**, not event-counted.

---

## 5. EAT — Error Accountability Trace

**Type:** Stream  
**Meaning:** Trace of representational failure

EAT does **not log users**.  
EAT does **not log actions**.

It records:
- when a projection failed
- why coherence could not be preserved
- which boundary was encountered

EAT exists for:
- epistemic integrity
- post-hoc audit
- structural learning

EAT is **read-only** and **non-reactive**.

---

## 6. MML — Memory of Mistakes Ledger

**Type:** Layer  
**Meaning:** Ledger of non-representable transitions

MML is **not learning**.  
MML is **not optimization**.

It marks:
- which transitions collapsed Φ
- which projections proved incoherent
- which configurations cannot recur

MML prevents repetition **without preference**.

It does not say:
> “Do this instead.”

It only says:
> “This cannot exist again.”

---

## 7. Attenuator (contextual note)

Attenuation is **not a component**.

It is a **field behavior** that:
- weakens projection amplitude
- reduces semantic sharpness
- preserves uncertainty

Attenuation may arise from:
- INS divergence
- NIR activation
- proximity to κ
- LTL conflict

---

## 8. Relations summary

| Element | Type | Can act | Can decide | Can store users |
|------|------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| INS | Stream | No | No | No |
| LTL | Layer | No | No | No |
| ESM | Layer | No | No | No |
| EAT | Stream | No | No | No |
| MML | Layer | No | No | No |

No epistemic layer or stream has agency.

---

## 9. Non-negotiable constraints

- No layer may bypass NIR
- No stream may influence Φ
- No memory may personalize output
- No temporal layer may be rewritten

Violation of any rule:
→ collapse to QE or silence

---

## 10. Closing anchor

These layers do not explain meaning.  
They **prevent its corruption**.

They do not produce intelligence.  
They **protect its conditions**.
