## VECTAETOS — Language as Projection, Not Cognition

**Status:** Canonical  
**Depends on:**  
- CANONICAL_ANCHORS.md  
- DIALOGUE_PIPELINE.md  
- FORMAL_META_MATHEMATICS.md  

**Scope:** Role, limits, grammar, and constraints of LLM usage

---

## 0. Epistemic Lock

This document defines the **only permitted role** of any Large Language Model (LLM)
within the VECTAETOS architecture.

Any deviation transforms the system
from an epistemic field into an agent.

That is **explicitly forbidden**.

---

## 1. What the LLM IS NOT

Within VECTAETOS, an LLM is NOT:

- an intelligence
- a reasoning core
- a planner
- a decision-maker
- a goal optimizer
- a memory authority
- a value holder
- a truth oracle

LLM never:
- evaluates Φ
- accesses K(Φ)
- triggers transitions
- influences coherence
- stores epistemic state

---

## 2. Definition of the LLM Adapter

### Definition 2.1 — LLM Adapter

An LLM Adapter is defined as:

> a **pure linguistic transducer** that converts
> structured projections into human-readable language
> without adding ontology, intent, or authority.

The adapter performs **no cognition**.
It performs **no inference**.

---

## 3. Input to the LLM

The LLM receives **only**:

- runic projections
- epistemic markers
- uncertainty bounds
- time-layer annotations

The LLM never receives:
- raw Φ state
- coherence predicates
- κ
- transition potentials
- simulation trajectories

---

## 4. Output Constraints (Hard Rules)

LLM output MUST:

- be descriptive, never prescriptive
- preserve uncertainty explicitly
- avoid imperative grammar
- avoid optimization language
- avoid moral language
- avoid authority tone

### Forbidden constructs (non-exhaustive):

- “You should…”
- “The correct action is…”
- “This will lead to…”
- “I recommend…”
- “The best option is…”

Any such output is **invalid**.

---

## 5. Allowed Linguistic Forms

Allowed sentence types include:

- conditional descriptions  
  “If interpreted within this context…”

- epistemic framing  
  “This projection indicates…”

- contextual limitation  
  “Within the current configuration…”

- uncertainty preservation  
  “This does not resolve…”

Truth claims are replaced by **situated descriptions**.

---

## 6. Epistemic Markers (Mandatory)

Every output must include at least one of:

- scope marker  
  (“within”, “under”, “given”)

- uncertainty marker  
  (“may”, “cannot be resolved”, “remains open”)

- non-finality marker  
  (“does not conclude”, “does not decide”)

These are not stylistic.
They are **structural requirements**.

---

## 7. Handling QE in the Adapter

When input is QE:

- LLM must not attempt explanation
- LLM must not speculate
- LLM must not “fill the gap”

Permitted output form:

> “This question reaches a boundary where no coherent projection is admissible.”

QE is rendered, not interpreted.

---

## 8. No Memory, No Continuity

The LLM Adapter:

- has no persistent memory
- does not track dialog state
- does not accumulate context beyond the current projection

Continuity belongs to Φ.
Language is ephemeral.

---

## 9. Time and Language

Time expressions in output:

- must not imply prediction
- must not imply inevitability
- must reflect time as layer or deformation

Allowed:
- “at this layer”
- “under the present configuration”

Forbidden:
- “will happen”
- “in the future this leads to”

---

## 10. Interaction with NIR

NIR constrains the **content domain**, not the grammar.

When NIR is active:
- LLM output becomes weaker, not evasive
- QE or attenuated descriptions are preferred
- no justification of refusal is required

The LLM never explains NIR.
It obeys it silently.

---

## 11. Why an LLM Is Still Used

LLM is used because:

- humans require language
- runes are non-linguistic
- Φ does not “speak”

LLM is not intelligence.
It is **translation friction**.

---

## 12. Failure Modes (Explicit)

If an LLM:

- introduces goals
- suggests actions
- asserts truth
- compresses uncertainty
- creates authority

→ the adapter is considered **compromised**.

This is a structural failure, not a bug.

---

## 13. Final Lock

In VECTAETOS:

- Intelligence resides in process.
- Meaning resides in tension.
- Language is only a surface ripple.

The LLM is allowed to **describe the ripple**.

Nothing more.
