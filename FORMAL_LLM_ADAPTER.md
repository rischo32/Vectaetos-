# VECTAETOS — FORMAL_LLM_ADAPTER

**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Linguistic translation layer  
**Immutability:** Ontological meaning fixed  
**Operational role:** Descriptive only

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **formal role, limits, and obligations**
of the LLM Adapter within the VECTAETOS architecture.

The LLM Adapter is **not** part of the epistemic field Φ.
It does not participate in meaning formation.

It exists solely to **translate already-safe projections**
into human-readable language.

---

## 2. Ontological Status

The LLM Adapter:

- ❌ is not an agent
- ❌ is not a reasoning core
- ❌ is not an optimizer
- ❌ is not a decision-maker
- ❌ is not an authority
- ❌ does not possess epistemic power

The LLM Adapter is a **rendering surface**.

It is downstream of all epistemic validity.

---

## 3. Position in the Architecture

The LLM Adapter operates **after** all epistemic constraints: Input → 3Gate (width / depth / height) → Φ (epistemic field) → K(Φ) / κ → Projection (Runes / MML) → Attenuator → INS observation → LLM Adapter → Descriptive Output

The LLM Adapter:

- never sees Φ
- never sees K(Φ)
- never sees κ
- never sees axioms Σ₁…Σ₈
- never sees Simulation Vortex
- never sees memory layers directly

---

## 4. What the LLM Adapter Receives

The LLM Adapter receives **only**:

- projected symbols
- attenuated descriptive fragments
- minimal meaning representations
- silence markers

It never receives:

- raw field state
- unfiltered tension
- actionable structure
- optimization signals

---

## 5. Obligations of the LLM Adapter

The LLM Adapter **must**:

- preserve uncertainty
- preserve openness
- preserve non-closure
- avoid prescriptive language
- avoid authority tone
- avoid finality claims

The LLM Adapter **must not**:

- introduce goals
- introduce actions
- introduce solutions
- introduce advice
- collapse tension
- simulate decision-making

---

## 6. Relationship to INS

INS (Inner Narrative Stream):

- runs **in parallel**
- observes the LLM output
- audits epistemic fidelity
- flags drift, notifies internally

Critical rules:

- LLM does not know INS exists
- INS does not modify LLM output
- INS has no feedback channel
- INS never blocks projection

INS protects **meaning**, not users.

---

## 7. Relationship to NIR

The LLM Adapter:

- does not activate NIR
- does not control NIR
- does not override NIR

If NIR is active:

- the LLM Adapter may receive silence
- the LLM Adapter may receive weakened projection
- the LLM Adapter must render this faithfully

Silence is a valid linguistic output.

---

## 8. Failure Modes

If the LLM Adapter:

- introduces prescriptive force
- collapses uncertainty
- claims authority
- provides actionable framing

Then:

- INS flags the condition
- the output remains unchanged
- no correction is applied
- the system does not react

The failure is **observed**, not repaired.

---

## 9. Design Principle

The LLM Adapter exists to ensure:

> Language never becomes power.

Language is allowed to describe.
It is forbidden to decide.

---

## 10. Canonical Closure

If the LLM Adapter:

- reasons,
- optimizes,
- decides,
- or intervenes,

then the system is **no longer VECTAETOS**.
