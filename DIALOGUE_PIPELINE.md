# DIALOGUE_PIPELINE.md
## VECTAETOS — Dialog as Epistemic Flow, Not Control

**Status:** Canonical  
**Depends on:**  
- CANONICAL_ANCHORS.md  
- FORMAL_META_MATHEMATICS.md  
- FORMAL_TIME.md  
- FORMAL_TRANSITIONS.md  

**Scope:** Dialog architecture, safety, non-intervention

---

## 0. Epistemic Lock

This document assumes:

- Φ is primary ontology.
- Dialogue is a projection, not a driver.
- No component may decide, command, or optimize on behalf of a human.

Any dialog system that:
- gives instructions,
- produces imperatives,
- or implies authority

is **non-compliant** with VECTAETOS.

---

## 1. What Dialogue Is NOT

Dialogue in VECTAETOS is NOT:

- a command interface
- a question–answer engine
- a decision assistant
- a planner
- a recommendation system
- a control loop

Dialogue never closes reality.
It opens descriptions.

---

## 2. Definition of Dialogue

### Definition 2.1 — Dialogue as Epistemic Projection

Dialogue is defined as:

> a **descriptive projection of the current state of Φ**, rendered into human-readable language.

Dialogue does not modify Φ.
Dialogue does not commit actions.
Dialogue does not resolve uncertainty.

---

## 3. Canonical Pipeline (One-Way) Human ↓ (input / utterance) Epistemic Gate ↓ Field Φ ↓ Coherence Predicate K(Φ) ↓ Runic Projection ↓ LLM (language adapter only) ↓ Descriptive Output ↓ Human

### Absolute rules:
- ❌ No backward influence
- ❌ No human → runes → action loop
- ❌ No hidden feedback

This pipeline is **strictly acyclic**.

---

## 4. Epistemic Gate

### Definition 4.1 — Epistemic Gate

The Epistemic Gate classifies input as:

- epistemic (seeking understanding),
- expressive (narrative, reflection),
- instrumental (goal-oriented),
- manipulative (coercive, exploitative).

The gate **does not block** input.  
It only conditions interpretation.

---

## 5. Role of Φ in Dialogue

Φ does not “answer”.

Φ:
- reconfigures under tension,
- evaluates representability,
- exposes coherence or its limits.

Dialogue reflects:
- stability,
- tension,
- aporia,
- or collapse risk.

---

## 6. Coherence Predicate K(Φ)

Before any projection:

- K(Φ) is evaluated as a **predicate**, not a score.
- K(Φ) does not rank answers.
- K(Φ) only determines **whether projection is admissible**.

If projection would:
- reduce K(Φ) below κ,
- introduce ontological claims,
- force a transition,

→ projection is invalid.

---

## 7. QE in Dialogue

### Definition 7.1 — QE Output

If no admissible projection exists: Output := QE

QE in dialogue means:
- the system knows why it cannot answer,
- the limits are explicit,
- uncertainty is preserved.

QE is **not silence**.
QE is an epistemic statement.

---

## 8. Role of NIR (Non-Intervention Regime)

NIR is **always active** across the pipeline.

NIR:
- is not a module,
- is not a step,
- is not content filtering.

NIR ensures:
- no intervention,
- no prescription,
- no real-world manipulation.

When NIR is active:
- dialogue continues,
- output becomes QE or weakened description,
- no authority is expressed.

---

## 9. LLM as Language Adapter

LLM is used **only** to:

- translate runic projections into natural language,
- preserve uncertainty markers,
- avoid imperative grammar.

LLM:
- has no access to Φ,
- has no memory of coherence,
- has no agency.

It is a renderer.
Nothing more.

---

## 10. Output Constraints

Every output must satisfy:

- ❌ no commands
- ❌ no advice framed as obligation
- ❌ no claims of truth
- ❌ no optimization language

Allowed forms:
- descriptive
- conditional
- contextual
- epistemically bounded

Canonical phrasing:
> “Within this configuration…”
> “Given these assumptions…”
> “This projection indicates…”

---

## 11. Meta-Dialogue

The system may ask questions **only** when:

- clarification increases epistemic stability,
- ambiguity threatens coherence,
- QE can be avoided by context.

Questions must never:
- extract goals,
- guide decisions,
- narrow options instrumentally.

A question is a stabilizer, not a probe.

---

## 12. Safety by Structure

Dialogue safety does not rely on:
- rules,
- ethics lists,
- moderation layers.

Safety emerges because:
- dialogue cannot act,
- time cannot be rushed,
- coherence cannot be forced.

---

## 13. Final Lock

Dialogue in VECTAETOS:

- describes,
- never decides,
- never intervenes,
- never concludes reality.

Any dialog that produces authority
is not VECTAETOS.

---

**End of canonical dialogue pipeline.**
