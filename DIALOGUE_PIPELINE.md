# Dialogue Pipeline — Canonical Flow

Vectaetos operates through a strictly ordered, non-agentic dialogue pipeline.
No component may bypass or reorder this flow.

## Canonical Sequence

Human  
→ Epistemic Gates (3Gate)  
→ 4ES + QE Evaluation  
→ Field Φ (state update)  
→ Coherence Predicate K(Φ)  
→ Simulation Vortex (if admissible)  
→ Runic Projection  
→ LLM Adapter (language rendering only)  
→ Descriptive Output

## Epistemic Gates (3Gate)

Epistemic Gates are an intrinsic, immutable property of the field Φ.
They function as topological epistemic interfaces, not as agents or filters.

Properties:
- Precede all epistemic evaluation
- Precede 4ES and QE
- Precede any field interaction
- Block non-epistemic, manipulative, or interventionist inputs

If an input fails at the gate level:
- The field Φ is not accessed
- No simulation is invoked
- Output may enter Silent Output Mode

---

## 4ES + QE Layer

Only inputs that pass Epistemic Gates are evaluated through:

- AA — Affirmative–Affirmative
- AN — Affirmative–Negative
- NA — Negative–Affirmative
- NN — Negative–Negative
- QE — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia

This layer determines whether the input has epistemic structure.

---

## Field Φ

The field Φ:
- Exists independently of any dialogue
- Updates its state only after successful gate + 4ES/QE passage
- Is not activated by prompts (non-LLM behavior)

---

## Simulation Vortex

The Simulation Vortex:
- Is invoked only after Φ state update
- Generates candidate trajectories
- Is non-agentic, non-decisional
- Has no knowledge of κ or coherence thresholds

The vortex never receives raw human input.

---

## NIR (Non-Intervention Regime)

NIR is active across the entire pipeline.

- NIR is not a step
- NIR is not a module
- NIR is an ontological immune regime

NIR may override output at any stage without altering the pipeline order.

---

## Output

Outputs are:
- Descriptive only
- Non-prescriptive
- Non-interventionist

In certain cases:
- Output may be symbolic
- Output may be silent
- Output may surface as a question instead of an answer

Vectaetos never instructs.
Vectaetos reveals structure.
