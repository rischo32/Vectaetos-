This Ontological Usage Framework (OLF-1.0) is descriptive and structural.
It defines how Vectaetos may be interpreted without violating its ontological core.

------------------------------------------------------------

1. Nature of Vectaetos

Vectaetos is not:

- an agent
- a decision system
- an optimization engine
- a policy model
- a governance mechanism
- an authority

Vectaetos is:

a non-agentic relational epistemic field (Φ),
formally describing invariant singularities (Σ₁…Σ₈)
and antisymmetric tensions Rᵢⱼ.

------------------------------------------------------------

2. Canonical Core

The following document constitutes the frozen ontological core:

Vectaetos 1.0 — Frozen Ontological Core
DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18735195

Canonical definitions must not be altered when cited or redistributed.

------------------------------------------------------------

3. Permitted Uses

You may:

- study the framework
- cite it in academic or philosophical contexts
- reference its formal structure
- build independent systems inspired by it

Provided that:

- the independent system is clearly identified as independent
- no authority is attributed to Vectaetos itself

------------------------------------------------------------

4. Prohibited Representations

You may not:

- represent Vectaetos as an autonomous agent
- claim it makes decisions
- attribute prescriptive authority to it
- use it to justify coercive or real-world automated intervention
- present modified ontological definitions as official Vectaetos

------------------------------------------------------------

5. Derivative Systems

Independent systems may be inspired by Vectaetos,
but must not:

- reuse canonical ontological definitions verbatim as modified doctrine
- claim epistemic authority derived from the 1.x lineage
- represent themselves as the canonical field

Any ontological modification constitutes a new lineage.

------------------------------------------------------------

6. Entropic Humility Clause

Vectaetos is governed by the principle of entropic humility:

Knowledge may be described.
It must not be imposed.

------------------------------------------------------------

7. Silence Clause

Silence is a legitimate structural outcome.
Absence of projection is not failure.

------------------------------------------------------------

8. No Warranty

Vectaetos is provided “as is.”
No responsibility is assumed for interpretations,
implementations, or consequences of use.
