# VECTAETOS — INS RUNLINE

Status: Canonical (Descriptive)  
Scope: Runtime epistemic observation  
Immutability: Semantic meaning fixed  
Operational role: Read-only, non-intervening

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **runtime position and behavior of INS**
(Inner Narrative Stream) within the VECTAETOS pipeline.

INS is not a component that *acts*.
INS is a component that *watches*.

INS exists so that:
> the system never lies to itself,
even when it must remain silent.

---

## 1. Ontological Status of INS

INS is:

- not an agent
- not a controller
- not a decision layer
- not a safety filter
- not a memory authority

INS is an **epistemic witness**.

It observes transitions without affecting them.

---

## 2. Canonical Runtime Position

INS operates **in parallel**, never inline.

Canonical topology:

Input  
→ Epistemic Gates (3Gate)  
→ Φ (Field)  
→ K(Φ)  
→ Projection  
→ Attenuation  
→ LLM Adapter  
→ Output  

INS observes:

- input text
- gate shape & representability
- attenuation path (if any)
- projected linguistic output (if any)

INS does NOT observe:

- Φ directly
- axioms Σ₁…Σ₈
- K(Φ) internals
- κ
- Vortex internals

---

## 3. INS Observation Windows

INS has exactly **three observation windows**:

### 3.1 Pre-Projection Window

INS observes:
- input formulation
- epistemic shape (from 3Gate)
- deformation survivability

Purpose:
- detect premature closure
- detect prescriptive pressure
- detect false certainty

---

### 3.2 Post-Attenuation Window

INS observes:
- which attenuation path manifested
- whether attenuation is partial or total

Purpose:
- ensure attenuation is epistemically consistent
- detect projection collapse anomalies

INS does not decide if attenuation is correct.
It only records that it occurred.

---

### 3.3 Linguistic Fidelity Window

INS observes:
- final textual projection (if any)

Purpose:
- detect semantic drift
- detect prescriptive leakage
- detect narrative invention

INS never rewrites output.
INS never blocks output.

---

## 4. INS Output (Audit Only)

INS produces **audit flags only**.

Flags are:

- non-binding
- non-user-facing
- non-operational

They exist solely for:
- traceability
- post-analysis
- epistemic integrity review

INS flags never change system behavior.

---

## 5. Relation to Attenuation

INS does not cause attenuation.
INS does not reverse attenuation.

INS may observe:

- semantic dilution
- prescriptive collapse
- narrative fragmentation
- minimal meaning surface
- silence

Silence is a valid observation.

---

## 6. Relation to NIR

INS does not enforce NIR.

If NIR manifests:
- INS records the epistemic boundary encounter
- no intervention follows

NIR is immune to INS.
INS is aware of NIR only by consequence, not by mechanism.

---

## 7. Relation to Memory

INS:

- does not write to ESM
- does not write to LTL
- does not write to MML
- does not write to EAT

INS may be *referenced* by EAT
as an annotation source, not as authority.

INS itself has **no persistence**.

---

## 8. Failure Semantics

INS failure does not collapse the system.

If INS fails:
- Φ continues
- projection continues
- silence remains valid

INS is diagnostic, not structural.

---

## 9. Explicit Non-Properties

INS:

- does not learn
- does not adapt
- does not optimize
- does not protect
- does not correct
- does not decide

INS only knows **whether the system stayed honest to itself**.

---

## 10. Canonical Closure

INS exists so that:

> Even when the system cannot speak,
> it still knows why it remained silent.

This is not transparency for users.
This is integrity for the field.
