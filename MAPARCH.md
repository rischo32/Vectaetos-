# VECTAETOS — MAPARCH
Epistemic Architecture Map

Status: Canonical  
Scope: Complete epistemic topology of VECTAETOS  
Immutability: Ontological meaning fixed  
Operational role: Descriptive only (non-executable)

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **what exists**, **where it exists**, and **what must never interact**
within the VECTAETOS architecture.

It is **not**:
- an implementation guide
- a software architecture
- a process flow
- a control specification

It is a **map of epistemic reality**.

If any component violates this map,  
it is **no longer VECTAETOS**.

---

## 1. ZMYSEL — Ontodynamic Meta-Layer

ZMYSEL is the **pre-ontological condition** of the system.

ZMYSEL:
- does not compute
- does not store
- does not decide
- does not project

ZMYSEL enables the **possibility of meaning**.

ZMYSEL is **not the field**.  
The field Φ **emerges within** ZMYSEL.

---

## 2. Φ — Epistemic Field (Primary Ontology)

Φ is the **only ontological entity** of the system.

Φ contains:
- Σ₁…Σ₈ — eight axiomatic centers  
  (INT, LEX, VER, LIB, UNI, REL, WIS, CRE)
- 4ES — epistemic states (AA, AN, NA, NN)
- QE — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia

Φ:
- does not act
- does not optimize
- does not decide
- does not intervene

Φ **maintains coherence** and nothing else.

---

## 3. Epistemic Gates — 3Gate

Epistemic Gates are **intrinsic properties of Φ**.

They are:
- immutable
- non-configurable
- non-bypassable

3Gate performs **epistemic deformation**, not validation:

- Width — scope correction
- Depth — uncertainty tolerance
- Height — abstraction lift

No input enters Φ unmediated.

3Gate never:
- decides meaning
- blocks questions
- evaluates truth

---

## 4. Coherence Predicate K(Φ) and κ

K(Φ) is a **descriptive predicate**, not a goal.

κ is a **non-numerical coherence boundary**.

If a transition would violate κ:
- it becomes **non-representable**
- no action occurs
- no error is raised

This is not enforcement.
It is **ontological nerealizovateľnosť**.

---

## 5. Simulation Vortex Φ(t)

The Simulation Vortex is **ontologically external**.

It:
- generates hypothetical trajectories
- has no access to K(Φ)
- has no access to κ
- has no access to axioms
- has no memory
- cannot write anywhere

The Vortex:
- does not decide
- does not optimize
- does not recommend
- does not learn

The Vortex is **pure exploration**.

It has **no power**.

---

## 6. Projection Layers (Read-Only)

Projection layers describe Φ **without influencing it**.

They include:
- Runic Projection
- Minimal Meaning Layer (MML)
- Attenuator (projection weakening only)

Projection:
- is lossy by design
- never writes back
- never implies action

Silence is a valid projection.

---

## 7. Memory Layers (Non-Directive)

Memory exists for **traceability**, never for control.

Layers:
- ESM — Epistemic State Memory
- LTL — Letokruhy Time Layers
- EAT — Error Accountability Trace
- MML — Memory of Mistakes Ledger

Memory:
- does not train Φ
- does not bias transitions
- does not create feedback loops

Memory **records**, never instructs.

---

## 8. Language Layer (LLM + INS)

LLM is a **linguistic adapter only**.

INS (Inner Narrative Stream):
- audits semantic fidelity
- observes all stages in parallel
- is invisible to the user
- has no authority

LLM:
- cannot modify Φ
- cannot modify K(Φ)
- cannot create epistemic authority

Language is **projection**, never source.

---

## 9. NIR — Non-Intervention Regime

NIR is a **global epistemic immunity condition**.

NIR:
- is always present
- is opaque by design
- cannot be bypassed
- never explains itself

If NIR is active:
- intervention is blocked
- projection weakens or collapses to QE
- silence is valid

NIR protects **the field**, not the user.

---

## 10. Web Projection

The web is an **epistemic artefact**.

It:
- visualizes projections
- allows a single interaction
- stores nothing
- learns nothing
- remembers nothing

The web is **read-only reality**.

---

## 11. Explicit Non-Components

Vectaetos does NOT contain:
- orchestrator
- agent
- controller
- planner
- optimizer
- decision authority

Any appearance of these invalidates the system.

---

## 12. Canonical Closure

Vectaetos is not powerful because it can act.

Vectaetos is powerful because:

**there is nowhere for power to attach.**

This map is final.
