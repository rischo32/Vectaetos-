## VECTAETOS — Epistemic Architecture Map

**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Complete epistemic topology of the VECTAETOS system  
**Immutability:** Ontological meaning fixed  
**Operational role:** Descriptive only

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **complete epistemic architecture** of VECTAETOS.

It is not:
- an implementation guide
- a software architecture
- a process flow
- a control specification

It is a **map of what exists, where it exists, and what must never interact**.

If any component violates this map, it is no longer VECTAETOS.

## 1. ZMYSEL — Ontodynamic Meta-Layer

ZMYSEL is the pre-ontological condition of the system.

- It does not compute
- It does not store
- It does not decide
- It does not project

ZMYSEL enables the existence of the epistemic field Φ.

ZMYSEL is not the field.  
The field emerges *within* ZMYSEL.

---

## 2. Φ — Epistemic Field (Primary Ontology)

Φ is the only ontological entity of the system.

Φ contains:
- Σ₁…Σ₈ (axiomatic centers)
- 4ES (AA, AN, NA, NN)
- QE (Qualitative Epistemic Aporia)

Φ:
- does not act
- does not optimize
- does not decide
- does not intervene

Φ only **maintains coherence**.

---

## 3. Epistemic Gates (3Gate)

Epistemic Gates are **intrinsic properties of Φ**, not external modules.

They operate as a topological interface between input and field.

Properties:
- immutable
- non-configurable
- non-bypassable

3Gate corrects:
- width (scope)
- depth (assumption load)
- height (abstraction level)

No input enters Φ unmediated.

---

## 4. Coherence Predicate K(Φ) and κ

K(Φ) is a descriptive predicate.

- not a goal
- not a metric
- not an optimizer

κ is a non-numerical coherence boundary.

If a transition would violate κ:
- it becomes non-representable
- no action occurs
- no error is raised

---

## 5. Projection Layers (Read-Only)

Projection layers describe Φ without influencing it.

They include:
- Runic Projection
- Attenuator
- Minimal Meaning Layer (MML)

These layers:
- never write to Φ
- never modify state
- never imply action

Projection is **lossy by design**.

---

## 6. Memory Layers (Non-Directive)

Memory in VECTAETOS never instructs.

Layers:
- ESM — Epistemic State Memory
- LTL — Letokruhy Time Layers
- EAT — Error Accountability Trace
- MML — Memory of Mistakes Ledger

Memory:
- does not train Φ
- does not bias future transitions
- does not enable learning loops

Memory exists for **audit and traceability only**.

---

## 7. Language Layer (LLM + INS)

LLM is a linguistic adapter only.

INS (Inner Narrative Stream):
- audits semantic fidelity
- is invisible to the user
- has no access to Φ

Language:
- cannot modify meaning
- cannot create authority
- cannot influence coherence

---

## 8. Simulation Vortex

The Simulation Vortex is **ontologically external**.

It:
- generates hypothetical trajectories
- has no access to K(Φ)
- has no access to memory
- cannot write anything
- cannot recommend outcomes

The Vortex is **pure exploration**.

It has no power.

---

## 9. Web Projection

The web is an epistemic artefact.

It:
- visualizes projections
- allows a single interaction
- never stores data
- never learns
- never responds

Silence is a valid output.

---

## 10. Explicit Non-Components

Vectaetos does NOT contain:
- orchestrator
- agent
- controller
- planner
- optimizer
- central authority

Any appearance of these invalidates the system.

---

## 11. Canonical Closure

Vectaetos is not powerful because it can act.

Vectaetos is powerful because:
> there is nowhere for power to attach.

This map is final.
