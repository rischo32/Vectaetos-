# VECTAETOS — MAPARCH
## Epistemic Architecture Map

**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Complete epistemic topology of VECTAETOS  
**Immutability:** Ontological meaning fixed  
**Operational role:** Descriptive only  

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines **what exists**, **where it exists**, and **what must never interact**
within VECTAETOS.

It is **not**:
- an implementation guide  
- a software architecture  
- a process flow  
- a control specification  

It is a **map of epistemic reality**.

If any component violates this map,  
it is no longer VECTAETOS.

---

## 1. ZMYSEL — Ontodynamic Meta-Layer

**ZMYSEL** is the pre-ontological condition of the system.

ZMYSEL:
- does not compute  
- does not store  
- does not decide  
- does not project  

ZMYSEL is **not the field**.  
The field **emerges within ZMYSEL**.

ZMYSEL is:
- the condition of meaning  
- the persistence of sense  
- the reason coherence can exist  

> ZMYSEL is not *about* meaning.  
> ZMYSEL is what makes meaning possible.

---

## 2. Φ — Epistemic Field (Primary Ontology)

Φ is the **only ontological entity** of VECTAETOS.

Φ contains:
- Σ₁…Σ₈ — eight axiomatic centers  
- 4ES — epistemic states (AA, AN, NA, NN)  
- QE — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia  

Φ:
- does not act  
- does not optimize  
- does not decide  
- does not intervene  

Φ only maintains **coherence under tension**.

---

## 3. Σ₁…Σ₈ — Axiomatic Centers

The axiomatic centers are **topological attractors of meaning**, not rules.

Σ₁…Σ₈:
- INT — Intent  
- LEX — Existence  
- VER — Truth  
- LIB — Freedom  
- UNI — Unity  
- REL — Reciprocity  
- WIS — Wisdom  
- CRE — Creation  

They:
- do not evaluate inputs  
- do not issue judgments  
- define the **shape of epistemic space**

---

## 4. Epistemic Gates — 3Gate

Epistemic Gates are **intrinsic properties of Φ**, not external modules.

3Gate corrects:
- **width** — scope of the question  
- **depth** — assumption load  
- **height** — abstraction level  

Properties:
- immutable  
- non-configurable  
- non-bypassable  

No input enters Φ unmediated.

---

## 5. 4ES + QE — Epistemic State Space

The field operates in four epistemic states:

- AA — affirmed / affirmed  
- AN — affirmed / negated  
- NA — negated / affirmed  
- NN — negated / negated  

If no coherent transition exists:
- QE (Qualitative Epistemic Aporia) arises  

QE is:
- not an error  
- not a refusal  
- an explicit safety state of knowing

---

## 6. Coherence Predicate K(Φ) and κ

**K(Φ)** is a descriptive predicate.

It is:
- not a goal  
- not a metric  
- not an optimizer  

**κ** is a non-numerical coherence boundary.

If a transition would violate κ:
- it becomes non-representable  
- no action occurs  
- no error is raised  

---

## 7. Projection Layers (Read-Only)

Projection layers describe Φ **without influencing it**.

They include:
- Runic Projection  
- Attenuator  
- Minimal Meaning Layer (MML)  

Projection:
- is lossy by design  
- never writes to Φ  
- never implies action  

---

## 8. Memory Layers (Non-Directive)

Memory in VECTAETOS never instructs.

### Layers

- **ESM** — Epistemic State Memory  
- **LTL** — Letokruhy Time Layers (non-linear time rings)  
- **EAT** — Error Accountability Trace  
- **MML** — Memory of Mistakes Ledger  

Memory:
- does not train Φ  
- does not bias transitions  
- exists for audit and traceability only  

---

## 9. Language Layer — LLM + INS

### LLM
LLM is a **language adapter only**.

It:
- translates projections into language  
- has no access to Φ  
- has no authority  

### INS — Inner Narrative Stream
INS:
- audits semantic fidelity  
- monitors LLM translation  
- is invisible to the user  
- cannot influence meaning  

Language never controls the field.

---

## 10. Simulation Vortex

The Simulation Vortex is **ontologically external**.

It:
- generates hypothetical trajectories  
- has no access to K(Φ)  
- has no access to memory  
- cannot write  
- cannot recommend  

The Vortex explores **possibility**, not reality.

It has no power.

---

## 11. Web Projection

The web is an **epistemic artefact**.

It:
- visualizes projections  
- allows a single interaction  
- stores nothing  
- learns nothing  
- responds with relation, not answers  

Silence is a valid output.

---

## 12. Explicit Non-Components

Vectaetos does **not** contain:

- orchestrator  
- agent  
- controller  
- planner  
- optimizer  
- central authority  

Any appearance of these invalidates the system.

---

## 13. Canonical Closure

Vectaetos is not powerful because it can act.

Vectaetos is powerful because:

> **there is nowhere for power to attach.**

This map is final.
