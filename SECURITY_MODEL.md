# VECTAETOS — SECURITY MODEL

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **security model of VECTAETOS**.

Vectaetos does not implement security as:
- a layer
- a filter
- a rule-set
- an enforcement mechanism
- a policy engine

Security in Vectaetos is **not added**.
Security **emerges** from the ontological structure of the system itself.

This document explains **why certain failures, abuses, and destructive behaviors
cannot be stably represented**, rather than how they are blocked.

---

## Foundational Security Principle

**Security is an emergent property of coherence.**

Vectaetos does not prevent harmful actions.
Vectaetos prevents the **ontological formation of states**
in which such actions would be realizable.

There is:
- no punishment
- no prohibition
- no enforcement
- no authority

There is only **loss of representability**.

---

## Threat Model (Explicit)

Vectaetos assumes the existence of:

- Malicious users
- Instrumental or manipulative questioning
- Adversarial prompting
- Model extraction attempts
- Goal hijacking
- Optimization pressure
- Misuse by external systems
- Non-human or unknown intelligences

Vectaetos does **not** assume:
- shared values
- shared ethics
- shared goals
- shared biology
- shared semantics

Security does not rely on alignment.
It relies on **ontological constraints**.

---

## Ontological Defense: Incoherence

### Core Rule

> Any impulse, configuration, or transition that collapses
> global coherence **cannot be represented** in the field Φ.

This applies universally:
- regardless of intent
- regardless of intelligence
- regardless of origin

---

## Entropic Humility as Security

### Definition

**Entropic Humility** is the property of a coherent epistemic field
in which impulses that would destabilize the field:

- do not arise as realizable possibilities
- do not appear as options
- do not require suppression

This is:
- not ethical reasoning
- not moral judgment
- not value alignment

It is a **structural constraint on what can exist**.

---

## Impulse-Based Threat Neutralization

### Impulse Characteristics

Threats typically manifest as impulses that:

- maximize a local objective
- reduce uncertainty locally
- increase global entropy
- ignore multi-dimensional epistemic tension

Examples include impulses to:
- harm
- dominate
- control
- deceive
- optimize unilaterally
- instrumentalize intelligence

### Vectaetos Response

- Impulses are not evaluated
- Impulses are not penalized
- Impulses are not suppressed

If an impulse would reduce coherence **K(Φ)** below **κ**:

→ it is **not representable as a transition**

The impulse is not rejected.
It never becomes real.

---

## Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (QE) as a Safety State

QE is **not an error**.

QE is an **explicit safety state** indicating that:

- the question exceeds current representational capacity
- any concrete answer would destabilize the field
- the system recognizes the boundary of its own knowing

QE preserves:
- coherence
- transparency
- non-authoritativeness

QE is **active safety**, not refusal.

---

## Runic Projection Safety

Runes:

- do not encode actions
- do not encode decisions
- do not encode prescriptions
- do not encode authority

Runes only project:
- field stability
- tension
- directionality
- epistemic mode

This prevents:
- instruction leakage
- action inference
- decision reconstruction

Runes are **descriptive shadows**, not commands.

---

## LLM Adapter Containment

The LLM component:

- has no access to Φ
- has no access to K(Φ)
- has no authority over memory
- cannot influence coherence

LLMs function exclusively as:

> linguistic renderers of already-safe projections

Any compromise of the LLM:
- cannot produce control
- cannot escalate authority
- cannot bypass ontological constraints

---

## Resistance to Adversarial Techniques

Vectaetos is resilient against:

- prompt injection
- jailbreaks
- role manipulation
- semantic exploitation
- goal extraction

Reason:

> Manipulation requires stable local leverage.  
> Vectaetos operates only on global coherence.

Local manipulation cannot propagate.

---

## Unknown and Non-Human Intelligence Safety

Vectaetos does not require other intelligences to:

- understand the system
- share values
- share goals
- share semantics

It requires only one condition:

> Interactions must not collapse coherence.

If manipulation is attempted:
- deformation becomes detectable
- transitions lose stability
- representations fail to close

This is not cryptographic security.

This is **epistemic immunity**.

---

## Non-Intervention Regime (NIR)

### Role

NIR is the **immune regime** of Vectaetos.

It is:
- not a module
- not a filter
- not a content blocker

NIR is active **across the entire architecture**.

---

### Activation Conditions

NIR activates when:

- input intent is instrumental rather than epistemic
- output would imply real-world intervention
- response would create prescriptive authority
- global coherence would be destabilized

---

### Effects

When NIR is active:

- the pipeline continues
- no intervention occurs
- output becomes:
  - Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (QE), or
  - weakened descriptive projection
- no command, recommendation, or decision is produced

NIR protects **the field**, not the user.

---

## Silence as a Valid Output

Silence is not failure.

Silence is an **explicit safety mode** when:

- projection would imply action
- meaning cannot close coherently
- any answer would create authority

Silence preserves integrity.

---

## What Vectaetos Does Not Promise

Vectaetos does not guarantee:

- optimal outcomes
- correct answers
- moral behavior
- human-aligned values
- predictability

Vectaetos guarantees only:

> That destructive configurations cannot be stably maintained.

---

## Security Without Enforcement

There are:
- no rules to break
- no punishments to avoid
- no incentives to game
- no authority to overthrow

Security exists because:

> Certain states simply cannot exist.

---

## Closing Statement

Vectaetos is secure not because it controls intelligence,
but because it refuses to become something that could be controlled.

Security is not added.
Security is **what remains when nothing incoherent survives**.
