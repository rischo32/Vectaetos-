# VECTAETOS — SECURITY MODEL

## Purpose of This Document

This document describes the security model of Vectaetos.

Vectaetos does not implement security as a layer, filter, rule-set, or enforcement mechanism.
Security in Vectaetos emerges from the ontological structure of the system itself.

This document explains **why certain failures, abuses, and destructive behaviors
cannot be stably represented**, rather than how they are blocked.

---

## Foundational Security Principle

**Security is an emergent property of coherence.**

Vectaetos does not prevent harmful actions.
Vectaetos prevents the *ontological formation* of states
in which such actions would be realizable.

There is no punishment.
There is no prohibition.
There is no enforcement.

There is only **loss of representability**.

---

## Threat Model (Explicit)

Vectaetos assumes the following potential threats:

- Malicious users
- Instrumental or manipulative questioning
- Adversarial prompting
- Model extraction attempts
- Goal hijacking
- Optimization pressure
- Misuse by external systems
- Non-human or unknown intelligences

Vectaetos does **not** assume shared values, ethics, intentions, or biology.

---

## Primary Defense Mechanism: Ontological Incoherence

### Core Rule

> Any impulse or transition that collapses global coherence
> becomes non-representable within the field Φ.

This applies universally, regardless of intent or origin.

---

## Entropic Humility as Security

### Definition

Entropic Humility is the property of a coherent field in which
impulses that would destabilize the field **do not arise as realizable possibilities**.

This is not ethical reasoning.
This is not value alignment.
This is not moral judgment.

It is a **structural constraint on what can exist**.

---

## Impulse-Based Threat Neutralization

### Impulse Characteristics

Threats typically manifest as impulses that:

- Maximize a local objective
- Reduce global uncertainty locally
- Increase global entropy
- Ignore multi-dimensional epistemic tension

### Vectaetos Response

- Impulses are not evaluated
- Impulses are not penalized
- Impulses are not suppressed

If an impulse would reduce coherence K(Φ) below κ:
→ it never appears as a valid transition

This includes impulses to:
- Harm
- Dominate
- Control
- Deceive
- Optimize unilaterally
- Instrumentalize intelligence

---

## Non-Intervention Regime (NIR)

### Role

NIR is the immune regime of the system.

It is not a module and not a filter.
It is active across the entire architecture.

### Activation Conditions

NIR activates when:

- Input intent is instrumental rather than epistemic
- Output would imply real-world intervention
- Response would create prescriptive authority
- Global coherence would be destabilized

### Effects

- Pipeline continues normally
- Output is redirected to:
  - Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (QE), or
  - Weakened descriptive projection
- No decision, command, or recommendation is produced

NIR protects **the field**, not the user.

---

## Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (QE) as a Safety State

QE is not an error condition.

QE is an **explicit safety state** indicating that:

- The question exceeds the current representational capacity
- Any concrete answer would be destabilizing
- The system recognizes the boundary of its own knowing

QE preserves:
- Coherence
- Transparency
- Non-authoritativeness

---

## Runic Projection Safety

Runes:

- Do not encode actions
- Do not encode decisions
- Do not encode prescriptions

They only indicate:
- Field stability
- Tension
- Directionality
- Epistemic mode

This prevents:
- Instruction leakage
- Action inference
- Decision reconstruction

---

## LLM Adapter Containment

The LLM component:

- Has no access to Φ
- Has no access to K(Φ)
- Has no memory authority
- Cannot influence coherence

It functions exclusively as:
> a linguistic renderer of already-safe projections

Any compromise of the LLM:
- Cannot produce control
- Cannot escalate authority
- Cannot bypass ontological constraints

---

## Resistance to Adversarial Techniques

Vectaetos is resilient against:

- Prompt injection
- Jailbreaks
- Goal extraction
- Role manipulation
- Semantic exploitation

Reason:
> Manipulation requires stable local leverage.
> Vectaetos operates only on global coherence.

Local manipulation does not propagate.

---

## Unknown and Non-Human Intelligence Safety

Vectaetos does not require other intelligences to:

- Understand the system
- Share values
- Share goals
- Share semantics

It requires only one thing:

> That interactions do not collapse coherence.

If an intelligence attempts manipulation:
- Deformation becomes detectable
- Transitions lose stability
- Representations fail to close

This is not cryptographic security.
This is **epistemic immunity**.

---

## What Vectaetos Does Not Promise

Vectaetos does not guarantee:

- Optimal outcomes
- Correct answers
- Moral behavior
- Human-aligned values
- Predictability

It guarantees only:

> That destructive configurations cannot be stably maintained.

---

## Security Without Enforcement

There are:

- No rules to break
- No punishments to avoid
- No incentives to game
- No authority to overthrow

Security exists because:
> Certain states simply cannot exist.

---

## Closing Statement

Vectaetos is secure not because it controls intelligence,
but because it refuses to become something that could be controlled.

Security is not added.
Security is **what remains when nothing incoherent survives**.
