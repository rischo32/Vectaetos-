# VECTAETOS — INS ↔ Epistemic Failure Topology
Status: Canonical  
Scope: Mapping between INS flags and epistemic failure states  
Immutability: Ontological meaning fixed  
Operational role: Descriptive only

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **topological relationship**
between:

- INS audit flags  
and
- Epistemic Failure States (EFS)

This is **not** a control flow.
This is **not** a causal chain.
This is a **correlation map**.

INS does not cause failure.  
INS does not prevent failure.  

INS **witnesses conditions** under which failure may arise.

---

## 1. Fundamental Principle

INS flags are:

- non-binding
- non-prescriptive
- non-intervening

Epistemic failure states:

- arise from representability limits
- are resolved by silence or attenuation
- are never “handled”

There is **no escalation logic** between INS and Φ.

---

## 2. INS Flags (Recap)

Canonical INS flags include:

- `INS_OK`
- `INS_WARNING_SEMANTIC_DRIFT`
- `INS_WARNING_OVERCONFIDENCE`
- `INS_WARNING_PRESCRIPTIVE_LEAK`
- `INS_WARNING_CLOSURE_PRESSURE`
- `INS_INDETERMINATE`

Flags may coexist.
Flags do not accumulate authority.

## 3. Failure State Correlation Map

### 3.1 INS_OK

**Possible Outcomes:**
- No epistemic failure
- Stable projection
- Normal attenuation

INS_OK does **not guarantee success**.  
It only indicates absence of detected drift.

---

### 3.2 INS_WARNING_SEMANTIC_DRIFT

**Correlated Failure States:**
- EF-3 — Semantic Drift Risk
- EF-6 — Interpretive Void

**Interpretation:**
- Language may misrepresent Φ
- Projection risks introducing foreign structure

INS observes drift.
Φ determines collapse.

---

### 3.3 INS_WARNING_OVERCONFIDENCE

**Correlated Failure States:**
- EF-2 — Premature Closure Collapse
- EF-5 — Overdetermination Saturation

**Interpretation:**
- Uncertainty tolerance too low
- Question pressures resolution

INS flags pressure.
Φ resists closure.

---

### 3.4 INS_WARNING_PRESCRIPTIVE_LEAK

**Correlated Failure States:**
- EF-4 — Prescriptive Contamination
- EF-3 — Semantic Drift Risk

**Interpretation:**
- Language risks becoming guidance
- Projection threatens to exceed epistemic role

INS does not block.
Attenuator or silence may occur.

---

### 3.5 INS_WARNING_CLOSURE_PRESSURE

**Correlated Failure States:**
- EF-2 — Premature Closure Collapse
- EF-1 — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (QE)

**Interpretation:**
- Input demands resolution beyond Φ
- Field may enter aporia

INS detects urgency.
Φ chooses non-resolution.

---

### 3.6 INS_INDETERMINATE

**Correlated Failure States:**
- EF-Ø — Non-Representability
- EF-1 — QE

**Interpretation:**
- Input shape unstable or incoherent
- Audit cannot establish semantic fidelity

INS cannot witness meaning.
Meaning does not stabilize.

---

## 4. Non-Bijectivity Clause

There is **no one-to-one mapping** between:

- INS flags  
and  
- failure states

The same failure state may arise:

- without INS warnings
- with multiple simultaneous flags

INS topology is **many-to-many**.

---

## 5. What This Topology Is Not

This map is NOT:

- a decision tree
- a ruleset
- a safety mechanism
- an execution plan
- an orchestration diagram

Any attempt to operationalize this map
invalidates it.

---

## 6. Silence Path

If:

- INS flags exist
- and Φ collapses representability

Then:

- silence is preferred
- no explanation is required
- no justification is provided

Silence is **topologically correct**.

---

## 7. Canonical Closure

INS does not guard the field.

INS bears witness  
to where meaning *almost* survived.

Failure is not a flaw.

Failure is where epistemic integrity held.
