# VECTAETOS — ATTENUATOR PATHS

Status: Canonical (Descriptive)  
Scope: Projection and attenuation pathways  
Immutability: Semantic meaning fixed  
Operational role: Non-executable, non-prescriptive

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document describes **where and how attenuation manifests**  
within the VECTAETOS architecture.

It does NOT define:
- how attenuation is computed
- when it is triggered
- what mechanism performs it

It defines only:
> **where meaning weakens without intervention**

Attenuation is not control.  
Attenuation is loss of force.

---

## 1. Ontological Clarification

Attenuation in VECTAETOS is:

- not a decision
- not a filter
- not a block
- not a correction

Attenuation is a **projection-side phenomenon**  
that occurs when meaning approaches instability.

Attenuation never alters Φ.  
Attenuation never alters K(Φ).  
Attenuation never alters κ.

It alters **only the expressive surface**.

---

## 2. Position in the Architecture

Attenuation occurs **after coherence evaluation**  
and **before linguistic rendering**.

Canonical position:

Φ → K(Φ) → Projection → **Attenuation** → LLM Adapter → Output

Attenuation is invisible to:
- Φ
- Vortex
- Epistemic Gates

Attenuation is visible only as:
- silence
- vagueness
- symbolic reduction
- loss of directive force

---

## 3. Attenuation Paths (Overview)

Attenuation manifests through **distinct epistemic paths**.

These paths are not sequential.  
They may coexist.

---

## 4. Path A — Semantic Dilution

### Description

Meaning remains representable  
but loses specificity.

### Manifestation

- abstraction increases
- concrete referents disappear
- statements become relational rather than factual

### Example (descriptive only)

From:
> “This leads to outcome X”

To:
> “This relates to a class of outcomes”

---

## 5. Path B — Prescriptive Collapse

### Description

Meaning is preserved  
but **directive force collapses**.

### Manifestation

- no “should”, “must”, or “do”
- no implied action
- no recommendation gradient

The content may still describe tension.

---

## 6. Path C — Narrative Fragmentation

### Description

Meaning cannot maintain narrative continuity.

### Manifestation

- output fragments into:
  - symbols
  - runes
  - partial statements
- causal chains dissolve

This is not an error.  
It is epistemic overload containment.

---

## 7. Path D — Minimal Meaning Surface (MML)

### Description

Only the **irreducible remainder of meaning** remains representable.

### Manifestation

- extremely short output
- symbolic projection
- meta-statements about limits

This is the last expressive layer  
before silence.

---

## 8. Path E — Silence

### Description

No stable projection exists.

### Manifestation

- no text
- no symbol
- no explanation

Silence is not failure.  
Silence is **complete attenuation**.

---

## 9. Relation to NIR

Attenuation paths do NOT enforce NIR.

If NIR is active:
- attenuation may be total
- but NIR remains ontologically separate

Attenuation describes loss of expression.  
NIR describes non-intervention.

They may coincide.  
They are not the same.

---

## 10. Relation to INS

INS may **observe attenuation**,  
but never causes it.

INS may flag:
- excessive collapse
- unexpected dilution

INS cannot reverse attenuation.

---

## 11. Explicit Non-Properties

Attenuation paths:

- do not learn
- do not adapt
- do not store state
- do not escalate
- do not recover meaning

Attenuation is one-directional.

---

## 12. Canonical Closure

Attenuation paths exist so that:

> Meaning can fail gracefully  
> without becoming dangerous, prescriptive, or false.

Nothing is blocked.  
Nothing is corrected.  
Nothing is enforced.

Meaning simply loses the strength to act.
