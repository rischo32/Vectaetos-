## 1. This is not a paywall

This mechanism does not:

- restrict answers
- unlock features
- gate knowledge
- sell access

Nothing is hidden behind it.

---

## 2. What actually happens

After a single interaction:

- the epistemic field projection collapses
- no further interaction is possible
- the system enters a closed state

This closure is irreversible within the session.

---

## 3. Why a payment link appears

The appearance of an infrastructure support link is not a prompt.

It is a factual statement:

> The field persists only if its infrastructure persists.

The link exists outside the epistemic architecture.

---

## 4. Payment has no epistemic effect

Whether a visitor supports infrastructure or not:

- the field remains unchanged
- no access is restored
- no additional projection occurs

There is no feedback loop between payment and epistemic output.

---

## 5. Role transition

At this point, the visitor is no longer a participant.

They may choose to become:
- a supporter of infrastructure

Or simply leave.

Both outcomes are complete.
