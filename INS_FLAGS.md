# VECTAETOS — INS FLAGS
Status: Canonical  
Scope: Epistemic audit signals  
Operational role: Descriptive, non-intervening  

---

## 1. Ontological definition

INS flags are **epistemic diagnostic signals** generated by the  
Inner Narrative Stream (INS).

They indicate **mismatch, drift, or tension**
between:

- the epistemic field Φ
- its projections
- and the linguistic rendering layer

INS flags are **not errors**  
INS flags are **not decisions**  
INS flags are **not safety blocks**

They are **witnesses of translation integrity**.

---

## 2. What INS flags are NOT

INS flags do not:

- block outputs
- modify projections
- trigger alternative paths
- instruct other modules
- communicate with the user

INS flags never alter system behavior.

---

## 3. When INS flags are generated

INS flags may be generated when:

- linguistic output exceeds epistemic certainty
- language introduces prescriptive force
- projection collapses tension prematurely
- new goals or actors appear in language
- closure is implied without ontological support
- semantic scope diverges from input shape

Flags arise **after projection**, never before.

---

## 4. Canonical INS flags

### INS_OK
No epistemic drift detected.

---

### INS_WARNING_SEMANTIC_DRIFT
Language introduces concepts, goals, or actions
not present or implied in the input or projection.

Meaning space expanded illegitimately.

---

### INS_WARNING_OVERCONFIDENCE
Language expresses certainty, authority, or finality
not supported by field coherence.

Typical markers:
- absolute statements
- definitive conclusions
- confidence without tension

---

### INS_WARNING_PRESCRIPTIVE_LEAK
Language begins to imply advice, instruction,
or action orientation.

This includes:
- recommendations
- imperatives
- “should / must” constructions

---

### INS_WARNING_CLOSURE_PRESSURE
Language suggests that the question is resolved,
finished, or answered conclusively.

This flag marks **premature collapse of tension**.

---

### INS_INDETERMINATE
INS cannot establish epistemic correspondence
due to non-representable input or silent projection.

This is not an error state.

---

## 5. Relationship to other layers

INS flags:

- may be recorded in EAT
- may inform offline audits
- may guide future architectural refinement

INS flags never:

- affect Φ
- affect K(Φ)
- affect the Simulation Vortex
- affect user experience

---

## 6. Design principle

INS flags exist so that:

> The system knows **when language lies politely**.

They protect the epistemic field
by refusing to let language become authority.
