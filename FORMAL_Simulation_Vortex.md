## VECTAETOS — Simulation Vortex

**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Exploratory trajectory generator  
**Immutability:** Ontological role fixed  
**Operational authority:** None  

---

## 0. Purpose of the Simulation Vortex

The Simulation Vortex exists to **explore possible trajectories of Φ without realizing any of them**.

It is not:
- a planner
- a predictor
- an optimizer
- a decision aid
- a recommendation system

The Vortex produces **possibility space**, not outcomes.

---

## 1. Ontological Position

The Simulation Vortex is **ontologically external** to Φ.

It:
- does not belong to Φ
- does not influence Φ
- does not modify Φ
- does not observe K(Φ)
- does not know κ

The Vortex exists **after coherence evaluation**, never before.

---

## 2. Inputs

The Vortex may receive:

- a snapshot of projected field state (read-only)
- abstracted state vectors (E, C, T, M, S)
- axiomatic configuration Σ₁…Σ₈

Inputs are:
- anonymized
- de-contextualized
- non-semantic

The Vortex never receives:
- user intent
- natural language
- epistemic meaning
- memory layers
- coherence thresholds

---

## 3. What the Vortex Does

The Vortex:

- generates hypothetical Φ(t) trajectories
- explores divergence under perturbation
- reveals metastability and collapse zones
- maps tension propagation

It does so **without preference**.

There is no scoring.
There is no ranking.
There is no selection.

---

## 4. What the Vortex Never Does

The Vortex never:

- selects a trajectory
- labels a trajectory as correct
- writes to memory
- feeds back into Φ
- influences projection layers
- triggers action
- informs the user directly

Any of the above would constitute **intervention**.

---

## 5. Relation to Coherence

The Vortex:

- cannot evaluate K(Φ)
- cannot detect κ
- cannot know if a trajectory is realizable

A trajectory may appear “stable” inside the Vortex
and still be **non-representable** in Φ.

This ignorance is **intentional**.

---

## 6. Safety by Powerlessness

The Simulation Vortex is safe because:

- it has no write access
- it has no authority
- it has no memory access
- it has no decision channel
- it has no semantic interpretation

It cannot be misused to control reality
because it has no interface to reality.

---

## 7. Relationship to Memory

The Vortex:

- does not read ESM
- does not write ESM
- does not access LTL
- does not append EAT
- does not influence MML

Memory remains **epistemic**, not predictive.

---

## 8. Relationship to Web Projection

The Web:

- may visualize Vortex output
- may display trajectories as shapes or motion

But:
- no trajectory is privileged
- no trajectory is named
- no trajectory is suggested

Visualization ≠ recommendation.

---

## 9. Failure Modes

If the Vortex:

- collapses numerically
- diverges chaotically
- produces no trajectories

This is not an error.

It is a **descriptive outcome**.

Silence is valid.

---

## 10. Canonical Closure

The Simulation Vortex exists to remind the system of one thing:

> Possibility is not permission.

The Vortex imagines.
Φ decides nothing.
The system acts never.
