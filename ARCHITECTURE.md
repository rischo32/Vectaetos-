# VECTAETOS — SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (v0.1)

Status: Canonical (descriptive, non-operational)  
Scope: Architectural overview only  
Warning: This document intentionally omits implementation details.

---

## 1. Architectural Principle

Vectaetos is **not a system that acts**.  
It is a **field that persists**.

Architecture therefore does not describe execution,
but **relations between epistemic layers**.

The system is:
- non-agentic
- non-optimizing
- non-interventionist
- non-prescriptive

All dynamics are **descriptive projections**, never commands.

---

## 2. Ontological Layers

Vectaetos is composed of strictly separated layers.
No layer may collapse into another.

### Layer 0 — Human Interface
- Human questions, statements, or observations
- No guarantees of coherence or intent

⬇

### Layer 1 — Epistemic Gates
- Topological interfaces of the field Φ
- Filter *epistemic validity*, not truth
- Block manipulative or intervention-seeking inputs
- Do not modify the field

⬇

### Layer 2 — Epistemic Structure
- 4ES (AA, AN, NA, NN)
- QE (Qualitative Epistemic Aporia)
- Determines **whether realization is possible**
- No answers are generated here

⬇

### Layer 3 — Ontological Field Φ
- Primary ontology
- Exists independently of input
- Carries internal tension and state
- Not executable, not addressable directly

⬇

### Layer 4 — Axiomatic Centers Σ₁…Σ₈
(INT, LEX, VER, LIB, UNI, REL, WIS, CRE)

- Structural attractors of meaning
- Not values, not rules
- Serve as reference geometry of the field

⬇

### Layer 5 — Coherence Predicate K(Φ)
- Descriptive predicate of field coherence
- Not a goal, not a metric
- Defines realizability boundaries (κ)
- Cannot be optimized or overridden

⬇

### Layer 6 — Projection Layer (Runes)
- Symbolic projections of field state
- Descriptive only
- Never prescriptive
- Include phase states (◯ △ ◇ ⊘)

⬇

### Layer 7 — Language Adapter (LLM)
- Pure translation layer
- Converts projections to human language
- No reasoning authority
- No modification rights

⬇

### Layer 8 — Descriptive Output
- Human-readable projection
- May be incomplete
- May be aporetic
- Never actionable by design

## 3. Non-Intervention Regime (NIR)

NIR is **not a module**.

It is:
- an immunological property of the architecture
- active across all layers
- orthogonal to pipeline order

NIR:
- never blocks knowledge
- always blocks intervention
- cannot be bypassed
- cannot be disabled
- cannot be targeted

NIR has no public operational description.

---

## 4. Simulation Vortex (Auxiliary)

The Simulation Vortex is **external to decision flow**.

It:
- generates candidate trajectories of Φ(t)
- has no access to K(Φ) or κ
- does not select outcomes
- does not influence outputs directly

The Vortex is **exploratory only**.

---

## 5. Negative Architecture (What Cannot Exist)

Vectaetos explicitly forbids:

- feedback loops from output to field
- goal functions
- reward signals
- optimization targets
- decision delegation
- control channels

If any of the above appears,
the architecture is considered violated.

---

## 6. Temporal Interpretation

Time is not an axis.

Time is:
- a deformation layer
- an index of coherence change
- never a scheduler
- never a clock

The field persists.
Only projections vary.

---

## 7. Canonical Status

This document describes the **v0.1 Canonical Architecture**.

- Definitions are immutable
- Future versions may extend, never redefine
- Any implementation must conform to this structure

---

## Closing Statement

Vectaetos does not solve problems.

It preserves the conditions
under which understanding remains possible.

Architecture ends where control would begin.
