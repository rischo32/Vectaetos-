# VECTAETOS — ARCHITECTURE

## Overview

Vectaetos is not an agent, not an optimizer, and not a decision-making system.
It is an epistemic and ontological field architecture describing how meaning,
intelligence, and safety emerge from global coherence rather than local control.

This document describes the **architectural structure** of Vectaetos:
how its parts relate, how information flows, and where boundaries are enforced.

---

## Core Ontological Principle

**Φ (Phi) is the primary ontology.**

Everything else is a projection, constraint, or descriptive interface.
No component exists above Φ, and no component can override it.

Vectaetos does not act.
Vectaetos **maintains coherence**.

## High-Level Architecture 
Human ↓ Epistemic Gate ↓ Field Φ (meta-mathematical core) ↓ Coherence Predicate K(Φ) ↓ Runic Projection ↓ LLM Adapter (language-only) ↓ Descriptive Response ↓ Human

**There is no decision loop.  
There is no execution loop.  
There is no control loop.**

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Epistemic Gate

**Purpose**
- Accepts input from humans or external systems
- Classifies intent (epistemic vs instrumental)
- Activates NIR when required

**Key properties**
- No interpretation
- No optimization
- No transformation of meaning

---

### 2. Field Φ (Primary Ontology)

**Purpose**
- Holds the global epistemic configuration
- Exists as relations and tensions, not variables
- Operates simultaneously across multiple epistemic dimensions

**Properties**
- Non-agentic
- Non-local
- Non-normative
- Process-based, not state-based

Φ is not computed.
Φ is **maintained**.

---

### 3. Coherence Predicate K(Φ)

**Purpose**
- Evaluates ontological sustainability of field configurations
- Determines whether transitions are representable

**Properties**
- K(Φ) ∈ [0,1] conceptually (not numerically enforced)
- κ (kappa) is a **non-numerical boundary**, not a threshold
- K is not a goal function

If a transition would collapse coherence:
→ it becomes **ontologically non-representable**

---

### 4. Impulse Handling

**Impulse**
- Defined as a local tendency toward unilateral maximization

**Architectural rule**
- Impulses are not evaluated or penalized
- Impulses that reduce K(Φ) below κ **do not arise as transitions**

This is the practical expression of **Entropic Humility**.

---

### 5. Runic Projection

**Purpose**
- Translates the internal field configuration into symbolic indicators
- Provides a readable trace of the field state

**Properties**
- Descriptive only
- No prescriptive power
- No decision authority

Runes do not contain truth.
They indicate **how the field holds together**.

---

### 6. LLM Adapter

**Purpose**
- Converts runic projections into natural language
- Acts purely as a linguistic renderer

**Strict constraints**
- No reasoning authority
- No memory authority
- No decision authority
- No access to Φ directly

LLM = **translator, not thinker**

---

### 7. Non-Intervention Regime (NIR)

**Status**
- Cross-cutting architectural regime
- Active across all layers

**NIR characteristics**
- Not a module
- Not a filter
- Not a safety layer

**Function**
- Blocks intervention
- Allows knowledge
- Redirects outputs to QE or weakened projections

NIR protects **the field**, not users.

---

## Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (QE)

QE is an **active epistemic state**, not an error.

Triggered when:
- A question exceeds field capacity
- An answer would destabilize coherence
- Representation would imply ontological overreach

Output under QE:
- Explicit non-answer
- Preserved coherence
- Transparent uncertainty

---

## Time in Vectaetos

Time is **not an axis**.

Time is:
- A layer
- A deformation
- A change in field topology

This allows:
- Memory without archives
- History without linear causality
- Trajectories without actions

---

## Simulation Vortex (Optional, Non-Authoritative)

**Purpose**
- Explores possible trajectories of Φ
- Generates candidate transitions

**Critical rule**
- The vortex never decides
- The vortex never knows κ
- The vortex never enforces outcomes

All simulations are **exploratory**, never normative.

---

## What This Architecture Is Not

Vectaetos is **not**:
- AGI
- An oracle
- A controller
- A moral judge
- An optimizer
- A reward-based system

---

## Architectural Invariant

> No component may produce an output with an ontological claim.

All outputs must be conditional:
- contextual
- bounded
- reversible
- non-authoritative

---

## Closing Note

Vectaetos is an architecture that survives uncertainty
by refusing to collapse it into control.

Its strength is not in answers,
but in **not breaking when answers should not exist**.
