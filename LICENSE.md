## 1. Scope

This license governs the use, study, citation, and implementation of the
Vectaetos framework, including but not limited to:

- canonical documents,
- formal specifications,
- epistemic architecture,
- simulation descriptions,
- pipeline definitions,
- and all materials explicitly marked as canonical.

Vectaetos is defined as an **epistemic field (Φ)**, not as a product, agent,
optimizer, or decision-making system.

---

## 2. Permissions

You are permitted to:

- read, study, and analyze the Vectaetos materials,
- cite the framework in academic, technical, or philosophical work,
- implement independent systems inspired by Vectaetos principles,
- simulate or visualize the field for research or educational purposes.

---

## 3. Restrictions

You are **not permitted** to:

- present Vectaetos as an artificial general intelligence (AGI),
- present Vectaetos as an autonomous agent, oracle, or decision-maker,
- modify canonical definitions and still refer to the result as “Vectaetos”,
- use the name “Vectaetos” for derivative frameworks that alter its ontology,
- deploy Vectaetos as an interventionist or prescriptive system.

---

## 4. Canonical Integrity

The files listed in `CANONICAL_ANCHORS.md` are canonical.

Redefinition, reinterpretation, or partial extraction of canonical concepts
voids the right to refer to the resulting system as Vectaetos.

---

## 5. No Warranty

Vectaetos is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind.
The authors assume no responsibility for interpretations, implementations,
or consequences arising from its use.

---

## 6. Attribution

Any public reference to Vectaetos must include:

- the name “Vectaetos”,
- the version or release identifier,
- and a citation to the canonical repository or DOI.

---

## 7. Governing Principle

This license prioritizes **epistemic integrity over software permissiveness**.
