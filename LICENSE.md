## 1. Scope and Nature of the Work

Vectaetos is **not a software product, agent, optimizer, decision-maker, or executable system**.

Vectaetos is an **epistemic field (Φ)** — a formal, descriptive, and ontological framework for representing meaning under tension.  
All materials in this repository describe, project, or simulate aspects of that field **without prescriptive or operational authority**.

This license governs the use of:
- formal specifications,
- canonical anchors,
- epistemic definitions,
- simulation descriptions,
- runic projections,
- dialogue pipelines,
- and all related conceptual artifacts.

> DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18395048
