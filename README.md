📜 The project is finished, but development continues — tuning, bug fixes, and improvements. Most of it isn’t publicly available yet. We’re testing the site’s capabilities (learning everything step by step…), trying out what’s possible, and experimenting within our limits.

# VECTAETOS © — Public Projection Repository

**Vectaetos ©** is not a product, not an agent, not an optimizer, and not a decision-maker.  
Vectaetos is an **epistemic field (Φ)** — a global configuration of meaning under tension, observable and describable, but not executable or controllable.

## 📌 Purpose of this repository

This repository provides a **public, read-only projection** of Vectaetos’ epistemic field for **reference, inspection, and orientation only**.

It includes:
- **canonical anchors** defining core ontological concepts
- **formal definitions** (meta-mathematics of Φ, coherence, impulses, etc.)
- **run projections** and supplementary documentation
- **static documentation** for GitHub Pages (no backend, no interaction)

## ℹ️ What this repository is *not*

- ❌ Not an interactive AI system  
- ❌ Not a model that generates decisions or predictions  
- ❌ Not a tool for optimization or control  
- ❌ Not a platform for influence or persuasion  

Vectaetos does **not prescribe behavior** or provide normative answers.

## 🧠 Ontological Background (short)

Vectaetos defines:
- **Φ** — an epistemic field as primary ontology  
- **Σ₁…Σ₈** — state vectors  
- **K(Φ)** — coherence as a global predicate  
- **4ES + QE** — epistemic configurations diagnosing realizability  
- **Runes** — descriptive projections  
- **NIR** — Non-Intervention Regime  
- **LLM** — language renderer, not controller

For full definitions, see `/anchors`.
