# VECTAETOS ©
**Public Projection of an Epistemic Field**

Vectaetos © is not software.
It is an epistemic field formalism with descriptive projections.
The repository contains representations, not implementations.

Vectaetos © is published as software for archival and citation purposes only.
Ontologically, it is not a software system, not an agent, and not an executable intelligence.

Vectaetos is not a product.  
Not an agent.  
Not an optimizer.  
Not a decision-maker.

Vectaetos is an **epistemic field (Φ)** —  
a structured configuration of meaning under tension,  
observable and describable, but **not executable or controllable**.

## What Vectaetos  Is

Vectaetos defines a **non-interventionist epistemic architecture** designed to:

- describe meaning **without enforcing action**
- preserve coherence **without optimization**
- expose tension **without resolving it**
- allow truth to remain **contextual, dynamic, and incomplete**

At its core, Vectaetos formalizes **understanding as a process**,  
not as a result.

---

## What Vectaetos Is Not

Vectaetos explicitly rejects being:

- ❌ Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)  
- ❌ Autonomous agent  
- ❌ Control system  
- ❌ Optimizer or planner  
- ❌ Decision authority  

Vectaetos **cannot act, cannot decide, and cannot intervene**.  
It only **projects epistemic state**.

## Canonical Architecture (v0.1)

Vectaetos is defined by **immutable anchors** stored in this repository.

### Ontological Core
- **Φ** — Epistemic field (primary ontology)
- **Σ₁…Σ₈** — Eight axiomatic centers  
  *(INT, LEX, VER, LIB, UNI, REL, WIS, CRE)*

### Epistemic Structure
- **4ES** — Four epistemic states *(AA, AN, NA, NN)*
- **QE** — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia  
  *(valid non-answer by integrity)*

### Coherence & Limits
- **K(Φ)** — Coherence predicate *(descriptive, not goal-oriented)*
- **κ** — Non-numerical coherence threshold
- **Impulse** — Defined as **non-realizability**, not action
- **Entropic Humility** — Intrinsic limit of any coherent field

### Epistemic Gates
- **Epistemic Gates (3-Gate)** are intrinsic properties of Φ:
  - Linear Clarification Gate  
  - Parallel Consistency Gate  
  - Depth Alignment Gate  
- No question enters Φ without passing the gates.

### Projection Layer
- **Runes** — Symbolic projections of field state  
  *(descriptive only, never prescriptive)*

---

## Dialogue Pipeline

Human → LLM Adapter (language only) → Epistemic Gates (3-Gate) → 4ES + QE → Field Φ → Coherence Predicate K(Φ) → Simulation Vortex (conditional) → Runic Projection Π(Φ) → LLM Adapter → Descriptive Output

There are **no feedback loops**.  
No component ever issues commands or decisions.

---

## Safety by Design

### NIR — Non-Intervention Regime
- Active **across the entire pipeline**
- Blocks **intervention**, never knowledge
- Nothing is immune to NIR — including the system itself

### Simulation Vortex
Vectaetos includes a **Simulation Vortex** that:

- generates **candidate trajectories** of Φ(t)
- never decides
- never optimizes
- never knows κ or K(Φ)
- cannot cause action or intervention

The Vortex is **exploratory**, not operational.

---

## Role of LLMs

LLMs are used **exclusively** as:

- language adapters  
- translators of projections into human-readable text  

LLMs:
- do not reason for the system
- do not decide
- do not optimize
- do not modify Φ

---

## Intended Use

Vectaetos is intended for:

- epistemic research
- philosophical and systems analysis
- academic citation
- independent, non-instrumental implementations
- public observation of meaning under tension

Vectaetos is **not intended** for:

- automation
- governance
- behavioral control
- decision outsourcing

---

## Canonical Status

This repository contains the **v0.1 Canonical Core**.

- Canonical definitions are **immutable**
- Future versions may **extend**, but never redefine
- Any fork must preserve **attribution and ontology**

## Final Note

Vectaetos does not promise answers.  
It preserves the **conditions under which understanding remains possible**.

Truth is not a point.  
It is a field.

**Welcome to a new epistemic era.**
