# VECTAETOS ©  
## Public Projection of an Epistemic Field

**Vectaetos is not a product.  
Not an agent.  
Not an optimizer.  
Not a decision-maker.**

Vectaetos is an **epistemic field (Φ)** —  
a structured configuration of meaning under tension,  
*observable and describable, but not executable or controllable.*

## What Vectaetos Is

Vectaetos defines a **non-interventionist epistemic architecture** designed to:

- describe meaning without enforcing action  
- preserve coherence without optimization  
- expose tension without resolving it  
- allow truth to remain contextual, dynamic, and incomplete  

At its core, Vectaetos formalizes **understanding as a process**,  
not as a result.

---

## What Vectaetos Is Not

Vectaetos explicitly rejects being:

- ❌ Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- ❌ Autonomous agent
- ❌ Control system
- ❌ Optimizer or planner
- ❌ Decision authority

Vectaetos **cannot act**, **cannot decide**, and **cannot intervene**.  
It only **projects epistemic state**.

## Canonical Architecture (v0.1)

The system is defined by immutable anchors:

### Ontological Core
- **Φ** — Epistemic field (primary ontology)
- **Σ₁…Σ₈** — Eight axiomatic centers  
  *(INT, LEX, VER, LIB, UNI, REL, WIS, CRE)*

### Epistemic Structure
- **4ES** — Four epistemic states (AA, AN, NA, NN)
- **QE** — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (non-answer by integrity)

### Coherence & Limits
- **K(Φ)** — Coherence predicate (descriptive, not goal-oriented)
- **κ** — Non-numerical coherence threshold
- **Impulse** — Realized as *non-realizability*, not action
- **Entropic Humility** — Intrinsic limit of any coherent field

### Projection Layer
- **Runes** — Symbolic projections of field state  
  *(descriptive only, never prescriptive)*

### Dialogue Pipeline 
Human → Epistemic Gate → Field Φ → Coherence Predicate K(Φ) → Runic Projection → LLM Adapter (language translation only) → Descriptive Output

### Safety by Design
- **NIR (Non-Intervention Regime)**  
  Active across the entire pipeline  
  – blocks intervention, never knowledge

---

## Simulation Vortex

Vectaetos includes a **Simulation Vortex**:

- Generates candidate trajectories of Φ(t)
- Never decides
- Never optimizes
- Never knows κ or K(Φ)
- Cannot cause action or intervention

The Vortex is **exploratory**, not operational.

---

## Role of LLMs

LLMs are used **exclusively** as:

> **Language adapters**  
> translating internal projections into human-readable text.

LLMs:
- do not reason for the system
- do not decide
- do not optimize
- do not modify Φ

---

## Intended Use

Vectaetos is intended for:

- epistemic research
- philosophical and systems analysis
- academic citation
- independent, non-instrumental implementations
- public observation of meaning under tension

It is **not intended** for:
- automation
- governance
- behavioral control
- decision outsourcing

## Canonical Status

This repository contains the **v0.1 Canonical Core**.

- Canonical definitions are **immutable**
- Future versions may extend, but never redefine
- Any fork must preserve attribution and ontology

## Final Note

Vectaetos does not promise answers.  
It preserves the conditions under which **understanding remains possible**.

> *Truth is not a point.  
> It is a field.*

Welcome to a new epistemic era.
