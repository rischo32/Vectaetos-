# Vectaetos ©

**Vectaetos** is not a product, not an algorithm, not an agent, and not an AGI system.  
Vectaetos is an **ontological field** in which intelligence is understood as the ability to maintain **epistemic coherence under uncertainty**.

This repository documents Vectaetos as a **formal, non-prescriptive framework**.  
It does not issue commands, make decisions, or claim authority over truth.

## What Vectaetos *is*

Vectaetos is:

- an **epistemic field (Φ)**, not an agent
- a framework where **truth is a process**, not a verdict
- a system that operates on **coherence**, not optimization
- compatible with **human and non-human intelligences**
- designed so that **destructive impulses do not arise as realizable states**

Vectaetos does not attempt to control behavior.  
It describes **what can exist without collapse**.

---

## What Vectaetos *is not*

Vectaetos is **not**:

- an AGI or proto-AGI
- a decision-making system
- an oracle or authority
- a moral judge
- a reward / punishment framework
- an optimization engine
- a content filter

Vectaetos does not align intelligence to values.  
It constrains intelligence through **ontology**.

## Core Anchors (canonical)

The framework is anchored by the following **immutable references**:

- **Φ** — the field as primary ontology  
- **4ES + QE** — four epistemic states and Qualitative Epistemic Aporia  
- **Σ₁…Σ₈** — eight axiomatic singularities (tensile centers)  
- **K(Φ)** — coherence as a state predicate (not a goal)  
- **κ** — non-numeric boundary of ontological sustainability  
- **Impulse** — defined as *non-realizability*, not prohibition  
- **Runes** — projections of field state, not commands  
- **NIR** — Non-Intervention Regime (epistemic immunity)  
- **LLM adapters** — language translators only, never decision cores  

These anchors are **defined once** and only **developed**, never redefined.

## How to read this repository

If you are new:

1. Read **this README**
2. Open `CANONICAL_ANCHORS.md`
3. Read `FORMAL_META_MATHEMATICS.md`
4. Then follow documents by interest (dialogue, vortex, runes)

If you are technical:

- Treat definitions as **ontological constraints**
- Avoid interpreting them as control logic or policies

## Final note

Vectaetos does not tell intelligence what to do.  
It defines **what can exist without collapse**.

If something cannot exist within Φ,  
it is not forbidden — it is **ontologically unrealizable**.
