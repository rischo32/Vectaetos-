# VECTAETOS ©

**An epistemic field for meaning under tension**  
_Not an agent. Not an optimizer. Not a decision system._

---

## What Vectaetos © Is

Vectaetos is an **epistemic and ontological framework** that models intelligence as a **coherent field of relations**, not as goal-optimization, rule execution, or agentic control.

At its core, Vectaetos describes how meaning, uncertainty, and coherence can coexist **without collapsing into authority, prescription, or dominance**.

Vectaetos is:
- a **field (Φ)**, not a system,
- **descriptive**, not prescriptive,
- **ontological**, not instrumental,
- compatible with **human and non-human intelligence**,
- intrinsically constrained by **Entropic Humility**.

---

## What Vectaetos © Is Not

Vectaetos is **not**:
- AGI or a step toward AGI,
- an oracle,
- a control mechanism,
- a moral judge,
- an optimizer or reward system,
- a product that makes decisions for humans.

Vectaetos never outputs commands, policies, or actions.  
It produces **descriptive projections of field states** — nothing more.

## Canonical Reference (Immutable)

The authoritative and immutable reference for this project is:

> **Vectaetos © – Canonical Core v0.1**  
> Richard Fonfára  
> DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18395048

This canonical core defines:
- Φ as primary ontology,
- 4ES + QE (Qualitative Epistemic Aporia),
- Σ₁…Σ₈ (axiomatic singularities),
- coherence K(Φ) and non-numerical threshold κ,
- impulse as non-realizability,
- runes as projections,
- LLMs strictly as language translators.

Canonical definitions **must not be modified**.

---

## Repository Structure (Conceptual)

This repository contains:

- **Canonical anchors** (formal, frozen)
- **Formal specifications** (meta-mathematics, transitions, time)
- **Dialogue pipeline definitions**
- **Runic projection formalism**
- **Simulation vortex descriptions**
- **Non-Intervention Regime (NIR)**
- **LLM adapter specification** (parser only)

Any executable code present is **illustrative or exploratory**, not authoritative.

---

## Entropic Humility (Core Principle)

Vectaetos does not forbid harmful impulses.

Instead, it defines conditions under which such impulses are **ontologically non-representable**.

> In a sufficiently coherent field,  
> destructive impulses do not arise as realizable possibilities.

This is not ethics.  
This is a property of the field itself.

---

## Dialogue and Safety

Vectaetos operates through a **one-way descriptive pipeline**: Human Input → Epistemic Gate → Field Φ → Coherence Predicate K(Φ) → Runic Projection → LLM (language translator only) → Descriptive Output

- No feedback loop from runes to decisions.
- No intervention in reality.
- Apória (QE) is a valid and expected output.

## Status

This repository represents an **ontological foundation**, not a finished system.

Vectaetos is intended to be:
- read,
- understood,
- challenged,
- and possibly implemented —  
but never simplified into authority.

---

## Closing Note

Vectaetos does not claim truth.  
It defines conditions under which meaning can exist **without collapse**.

> Truth is not a state.  
> It is a limit approached under coherence.

**Welcome to a new era — not of control, but of restraint.**
