### "Cogito cohaerenter ergo sum possibile"

### > "Welcome to a new epistemic era"

"Vectaetos nepomáha riešiť problémy.
Pomáha ich konečne vidieť celé."

"QE Apória nie je slabosť systému.
Je to jeho architektonická cnosť."

"Vectaetos nepredstiera poznanie pravdy o realite.
Operuje opatrne, z vedomej neistoty o nej."

Vectaetos © is **not software**.
It is an **epistemic field formalism** with descriptive projections.

This repository exists for **archival, citation, and public reading purposes only**.

Ontologically, Vectaetos is **not**:
- a software system
- an agent
- an optimizer
- a decision-maker
- an executable intelligence

---

## What VectaetOS Is

Vectaetos is an **epistemic field (Φ)** —
a structured configuration of meaning under tension,
observable and describable,
but **never executable or controllable**.

It shifts meaning:
from objects → to relations  
from answers → to coherence  
from decisions → to boundaries  

Vectaetos does **not** solve problems.
It preserves the conditions under which understanding remains possible.

---

## What VectaetOS Is Not

Vectaetos explicitly rejects being:

❌ Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)  
❌ Autonomous agent  
❌ Control or governance system  
❌ Optimizer or planner  
❌ Decision authority  

Vectaetos cannot act.
Vectaetos cannot decide.
Vectaetos cannot intervene.

It only **projects epistemic state**.

---

## Canonical Architecture (v0.1.1)

Vectaetos is defined exclusively by **immutable canonical anchors** stored in this repository.

### Ontological Core
- **Φ** — Epistemic field (primary ontology)
- **Σ₁…Σ₈** — Eight axiomatic centers  
  (INT, LEX, VER, LIB, UNI, REL, WIS, CRE)

### Epistemic Structure
- **4ES** — Four epistemic states (AA, AN, NA, NN)
- **QE** — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia  
  (a valid non-answer by integrity, not ignorance)

### Coherence & Limits
- **K(Φ)** — Coherence predicate (descriptive only)
- **κ** — Non-numerical coherence boundary
- **Impulse** — Defined as non-realizability
- **Entropic Humility** — Intrinsic limit of any coherent field

### Epistemic Gates
- **3-Gate** — intrinsic topological properties of Φ  
  (width, depth, height of representability)

No input enters Φ unmediated.

---

## Projection & Dialogue Pipeline

Human  
→ Epistemic Gates (3-Gate)  
→ 4ES + QE  
→ Field Φ  
→ Coherence Predicate K(Φ)  
→ Simulation Vortex (external, conditional)  
→ Runic Projection Π(Φ)  
→ LLM Adapter (language only)  
→ Descriptive Output

There are **no feedback loops**.  
No component ever issues commands or recommendations.

---

## Simulation Vortex

Vectaetos includes an external **Simulation Vortex**, which:

- generates candidate trajectories of Φ(t)
- never decides
- never optimizes
- never knows K(Φ) or κ
- never writes back to Φ
- cannot cause action or intervention

The Vortex is **exploratory**, not operational.

Its role is to expose **possible deformations**, not solutions.

---

## Language Layer

Large Language Models (LLMs) are used **only** as:

- linguistic adapters
- translators of projections into human-readable text

LLMs:
- do not reason for the system
- do not decide
- do not optimize
- do not modify Φ

Semantic fidelity is audited by **INS (Inner Narrative Stream)**,
which observes but never intervenes.

---

## Safety by Design

- **NIR — Non-Intervention Regime**
  - global immunity condition
  - blocks intervention, never knowledge
  - opaque by design

If intervention would occur:
the system weakens, redirects, or falls silent.

Silence is a valid outcome.

---

## Intended Use

Vectaetos is intended for:

- epistemic research
- philosophical and systems analysis
- academic citation
- independent, non-instrumental implementations
- public observation of meaning under tension

Vectaetos is **not** intended for:

- automation
- governance
- behavioral control
- decision outsourcing
- optimization tasks

---

## Canonical Status

This repository contains the **Canonical Core v0.1.1**.

- Canonical definitions are immutable.
- Future versions may extend, but never redefine.
- Any fork must preserve attribution and ontology.

See: `CANONICAL_ANCHORS.md`

## Final Note

Vectaetos does not promise answers.

It preserves the boundary
between what can be asked
and what must remain open.

Truth is not a point.
It is a field.
