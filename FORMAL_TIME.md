## VECTAETOS — Time as Layer, Not Axis

**Status:** Canonical  
**Depends on:** FORMAL_META_MATHEMATICS.md, FORMAL_TRANSITIONS.md, CANONICAL_ANCHORS.md  
**Scope:** Ontological temporality (non-metric, non-linear)

## 0. Epistemic Lock

This document assumes:

- Φ is a field, not an agent.
- Transitions are trajectories, not actions.
- Coherence K(Φ) is a predicate, not a goal.

Any interpretation of time as:
- a global axis,
- a metric clock,
- a scheduler,
- or an optimization horizon

is invalid.

---

## 1. What Time Is NOT

Time in VECTAETOS is NOT:

- a numerical axis (t ∈ ℝ)
- a clock
- a sequence of steps
- a progress metric
- a deadline
- a causal ruler

There is no universal “now”.

---

## 2. Definition of Time

### Definition 2.1 — Time as Deformation Layer

Time is defined as a **layer of deformation** over Φ: τ : Φ → Φ'

Where:
- τ is not measurable,
- τ is not ordered globally,
- τ is not comparable across contexts.

Time exists only **as change in representability**.

---

## 3. Temporal Index (τ)

### Definition 3.1 — Temporal Index

τ is an **index of ontological deformation**, not duration.

Properties: 
- τ is local to Φ,
- τ increments only when topology changes,
- τ does not advance during stable coherence.

No change → no time.

---

## 4. Time Emerges from Transitions

Time does not drive transitions.  
Transitions **generate** time.

Formally: If Φ(τ) ≡ Φ(τ + Δτ) → Δτ = 0 If Φ(τ) ≠ Φ(τ + Δτ) → Δτ exists

Time is an effect, not a cause.

---

## 5. Irreversibility

### Definition 5.1 — Temporal Irreversibility

A transition is temporally irreversible if:

- Φ cannot return to a previous configuration
  without violating K(Φ).

This irreversibility:
- does not require entropy maximization,
- does not require memory storage,
- arises from topological change.

There is no rewind.

---

## 6. No Global Ordering

Different regions of Φ may have:

- different τ densities,
- asynchronous deformation,
- non-alignable temporal layers.

Therefore:
- there is no global timeline,
- no universal sequence of events.

Synchronization is impossible by design.

---

## 7. Memory vs Time

Memory M is NOT time.

Memory arises only when:
- deformation is irreversible,
- coherence is preserved,
- anomaly crosses significance.

Time may pass without memory.
Memory may exist without duration.

---

## 8. QE and Time Saturation

### Definition 8.1 — Temporal Saturation (QE)

In QE:

- no admissible transition exists,
- further deformation increases incoherence,
- τ cannot advance meaningfully.

QE is a **temporal plateau**, not a pause.

The field is active.
Time is saturated.

---

## 9. Time and Safety

Because time is not a control variable:

- no acceleration strategy exists,
- no rush toward outcome is possible,
- no deadline pressure can form.

This prevents:
- instrumental escalation,
- forced convergence,
- optimization collapse.

Safety emerges structurally.

---

## 10. Implementation Constraint

Any implementation:

- MUST NOT use wall-clock time as ontology,
- MAY use clocks only as external simulation aids,
- MUST treat τ as derived from transitions,
- MUST NOT expose τ as a user-facing metric.

---

## 11. Human Interpretation (Non-Formal)

For humans:
- time appears as narrative,
- sequences are read retrospectively,
- causality is reconstructed, not enforced.

This is a projection.
Not the field.

---

## 12. Final Lock

Time in VECTAETOS is:

- a layer,
- a deformation,
- an index of change,
- never an axis.

Any system that reintroduces time as control
is no longer VECTAETOS.

**End of canonical time formalism.**
