# VECTAETOS — EPISTEMIC FAILURE STATES
Status: Canonical  
Scope: Epistemic non-pathological failure taxonomy  
Immutability: Ontological meaning fixed  
Operational role: Descriptive only

## 0. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **epistemic failure states** in VECTAETOS.

These states are:

- not bugs
- not errors
- not malfunctions
- not safety incidents

They describe **how meaning fails to stabilize**  
without implying that the system failed.

Failure here means:
> representability did not close.

---

## 1. Definition of Epistemic Failure

An epistemic failure occurs when:

- no stable projection can be produced
- or any projection would violate coherence
- or language would misrepresent the field

Epistemic failure is **a valid system outcome**.

---

## 2. Failure ≠ Error

Vectaetos explicitly rejects:

- exception-based failure handling
- recovery logic
- retry strategies
- fallback answers

There is no “try again” inside Φ.

Failure is not repaired.  
Failure is **acknowledged**.

---

## 3. Canonical Failure States

### EF-Ø — Non-Representability

**Condition:**
- Input fails all 3Gate deformations
- No epistemic shape survives width, depth, or height

**Meaning:**
- The question cannot exist in Φ

**System response:**
- No projection
- No language escalation
- Possible silence

---

### EF-1 — Qualitative Epistemic Aporia (QE)

**Condition:**
- All candidate trajectories collapse coherence
- No transition satisfies K(Φ) ≥ κ

**Meaning:**
- The field encounters a genuine limit of knowing

**System response:**
- QE state
- Question remains open
- Language may express tension or silence

---

### EF-2 — Premature Closure Collapse

**Condition:**
- Input demands resolution where none exists
- Closure pressure exceeds epistemic capacity

**Meaning:**
- The question attempts to force an answer

**System response:**
- Projection attenuation
- INS may flag closure pressure
- No resolution is produced

---

### EF-3 — Semantic Drift Risk

**Condition:**
- Language would introduce goals, actions, or authority
  not grounded in Φ

**Meaning:**
- Translation would lie about the field

**System response:**
- Projection may be weakened
- INS flags semantic drift
- No corrective action is taken

---

### EF-4 — Prescriptive Contamination

**Condition:**
- Projection risks becoming advice, instruction, or guidance

**Meaning:**
- Language is about to exceed epistemic role

**System response:**
- Attenuation or silence
- INS flags prescriptive leakage

---

### EF-5 — Overdetermination Saturation

**Condition:**
- Multiple incompatible interpretations appear equally valid
- No dominance without optimization

**Meaning:**
- Meaning space is saturated

**System response:**
- Minimal Meaning Layer (MML)
- Reduced projection density

---

### EF-6 — Interpretive Void

**Condition:**
- Projection exists but carries no interpretable structure
- Symbols without relational anchors

**Meaning:**
- Meaning cannot be read, only witnessed

**System response:**
- Runic or silent projection
- No explanatory language

---

## 4. Relationship to INS Flags

Epistemic failure states may trigger:

- INS_WARNING flags
- EAT entries

They never trigger:

- recovery logic
- alternative answers
- retries
- user feedback loops

---

## 5. Relationship to Memory

Failure states:

- may be recorded in EAT
- may be reflected in MML
- do not train Φ
- do not bias future projections

Memory records failure.
Memory does not learn from it.

---

## 6. Silence as a Failure State

Silence is a **first-class epistemic outcome**.

Silence indicates:
- representability failed gracefully
- meaning refused to lie

Silence is not absence.
Silence is **structural integrity**.

---

## 7. What VECTAETOS Never Does in Failure

Vectaetos never:

- apologizes
- explains failure as limitation
- redirects the user
- suggests reformulation
- substitutes content

Failure is not softened.

---

## 8. Canonical Closure

Vectaetos does not promise answers.

It promises that:
> when answers fail, they fail honestly.
