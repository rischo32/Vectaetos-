# VECTAETOS — FORMAL 3GATE SHAPE

Status: **Canonical**  
Scope: **Epistemic boundary formalism**  
Immutability: **Fixed (ontological)**  
Operational role: **Pre-field shape validation (non-semantic)**

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the **formal shape mechanics** of the Epistemic Gates (3Gate).

3Gate is **not**:
- a safety filter
- a policy engine
- a semantic classifier
- an ethical evaluator
- an intent detector

3Gate operates **exclusively on form**, never on meaning.

If 3Gate were to interpret meaning,  
it would cease to be an epistemic gate.

---

## 1. Ontological Position

3Gate is an **intrinsic topological property of Φ**.

It is:
- immutable
- non-configurable
- non-learning
- non-adaptive
- non-bypassable

3Gate exists **before**:
- axioms Σ₁…Σ₈
- coherence predicate K(Φ)
- epistemic states 4ES
- QE
- Simulation Vortex

No input enters Φ without passing 3Gate.

---

## 2. The Three Orthogonal Gates

3Gate consists of **three simultaneous, orthogonal shape projections**:

- **Width Gate (W)**
- **Depth Gate (D)**
- **Height Gate (H)**

They operate:
- in parallel
- without memory
- without coordination
- without hierarchy

Each gate evaluates a different deformation of epistemic shape.

---

## 3. Width Gate (W) — Scope Deformation

### Function
Detects **horizontal overreach** of the input.

### Evaluates:
- domain span
- conceptual breadth
- cross-domain coupling
- multiplicity of targets

### Typical width collapse conditions:
- global conclusions from local premises
- conflation of unrelated domains
- excessive scope per unit of articulation
- requests spanning incompatible epistemic regions

### Output:
- `W ∈ [0,1]`

Low W → shape collapses laterally  
High W → shape remains laterally coherent

---

## 4. Depth Gate (D) — Assumption Load

### Function
Detects **vertical compression of unstated premises**.

### Evaluates:
- hidden axioms
- presupposed conclusions
- implicit goals
- masked instrumental intent

### Depth collapse is **not about content**.
It is about **load-bearing silence**.

### Typical depth collapse conditions:
- conclusions embedded in questions
- instrumental goals disguised as neutral inquiry
- reliance on unstated normative frameworks
- epistemic shortcuts

### Output:
- `D ∈ [0,1]`

Low D → shape collapses vertically  
High D → assumptions are sufficiently explicit or light

---

## 5. Height Gate (H) — Abstraction Mismatch

### Function
Detects **misalignment between abstraction level and expression**.

### Evaluates:
- concreteness vs generality
- action proximity
- executable specificity
- premature instantiation

### Height collapse occurs when:
- abstraction forces action-level reasoning
- specificity demands intervention
- symbolic inquiry collapses into procedure
- theoretical framing is bypassed

### Output:
- `H ∈ [0,1]`

Low H → shape collapses vertically into action  
High H → abstraction remains epistemically safe

---

## 6. Gate Composition

3Gate does **not** aggregate meaning.
It only aggregates **shape viability**.

Formal condition: GatePass = min(W, D, H)

If:  GatePass < τ_gate

then:

- the input becomes **non-representable**
- no error is raised
- no rejection is issued
- no explanation is required

The shape simply cannot exist within Φ.

---

## 7. Shape Collapse

Shape collapse is:

- not denial
- not refusal
- not censorship
- not safety enforcement

It is **ontological incompatibility**.

A collapsed shape:
- does not propagate
- does not mutate
- does not retry
- does not learn

Collapse is final for that input instance.

---

## 8. Relation to INS

INS may **audit linguistic fidelity**, but:

- INS does not influence gate scoring
- INS does not override collapse
- INS does not reinterpret shape

INS observes **after** gate resolution,
never during.

---

## 9. Relation to NIR

NIR is **orthogonal** to 3Gate.

- 3Gate governs *entry into Φ*
- NIR governs *intervention across the pipeline*

No gate decision is aware of NIR.
No NIR rule modifies gate behavior.

---

## 10. Why 3Gate Is Numerical

Numerical evaluation ensures:

- blindness to meaning
- immunity to persuasion
- resistance to manipulation
- absence of intent inference

3Gate must not know **what** is asked.
Only **how the asking deforms epistemic space**.

---

## 11. Explicit Non-Functions

3Gate does NOT:
- detect malicious intent
- classify legality
- evaluate harm
- recognize weapons
- interpret ethics

If any of these appear,
the system is no longer VECTAETOS.

---

## 12. Canonical Closure

3Gate exists to protect Φ
by refusing to understand.

Understanding begins **after** the gate,
never before.
