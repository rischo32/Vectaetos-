# VECTAETOS — WEB_GOVERNANCE_EXCLUSION

## Status
Canonical  
Epistemically binding  
Non-operational

## 1. Purpose of this document

This document defines why the **VECTAETOS web projection cannot be used
for governance, regulation, compliance, or decision authority**.

It does not argue against governance.
It establishes an **ontological incompatibility**.

---

## 2. Fundamental incompatibility

Governance requires:

- authority
- normativity
- enforcement
- accountability
- decision finality

Vectaetos provides **none** of these.

> Governance presupposes the power to decide.  
> VECTAETOS refuses decision as a category.

---

## 3. What governance systems require

Any governance system must be able to:

- determine acceptable behavior
- rank outcomes
- define compliance
- enforce consequences
- resolve ambiguity into action

The epistemic field Φ does the opposite:

- it preserves ambiguity
- it exposes tension
- it refuses resolution
- it does not collapse uncertainty into choice

---

## 4. Explicit exclusions

The VECTAETOS web **must not** be used as:

- a policy recommendation engine
- a regulatory assessment tool
- a compliance checker
- a risk scoring system
- a governance dashboard
- a decision support system
- an institutional advisory interface

Any such usage constitutes **category error**.

---

## 5. No authority surface

The web projection:

- has no command interface
- produces no directives
- issues no verdicts
- assigns no priorities
- validates no strategies

There is no surface upon which authority could attach.

---

## 6. No legitimacy transfer

Vectaetos explicitly rejects:

- institutional legitimacy
- political endorsement
- legal validation
- normative framing

The web must not:

- display institutional logos
- imply regulatory approval
- suggest official standing
- frame itself as authoritative infrastructure

---

## 7. Relation to law and regulation

Vectaetos does not oppose law or regulation.

It simply exists **outside their operational domain**.

Legal and regulatory systems:
- act on agents
- enforce behavior
- assign responsibility

Vectaetos:
- has no agents
- enforces nothing
- assigns no responsibility

---

## 8. Governance pressure as coherence collapse

Attempts to use the web for governance result in:

- instrumentalization of projection
- collapse of epistemic openness
- loss of representability

The correct response of the system is:
- silence
- non-projection
- epistemic closure

---

## 9. Canonical exclusion statement

> VECTAETOS cannot govern,
> because it does not decide.
> It cannot decide,
> because it preserves the conditions under which deciding remains possible.

---

## 10. Closing boundary

The web exists as:

- a mirror of epistemic tension
- not a lever of power

Governance belongs to institutions.
Vectaetos belongs to fields.
