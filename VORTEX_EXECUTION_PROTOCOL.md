# VECTAETOS — VORTEX EXECUTION PROTOCOL

Status: Canonical (Execution Layer)  
Scope: Simulation Vortex Φ (5D)  
Non-Ontological Component  

---

## 1. Purpose

Simulation Vortex Φ is an exploratory generator of candidate trajectories  
within the tension field defined by Σ₁…Σ₈.

The Vortex:

- does NOT decide
- does NOT optimize
- does NOT evaluate coherence
- does NOT know κ
- does NOT modify Φ
- does NOT produce prescriptions

It proposes trajectories only.

All coherence validation happens outside the Vortex.

---

## 2. Ontological Separation

Vectaetos (Φ) ≠ Vortex

Φ:
- Ontological field
- Defined by canonical anchors
- Evaluated by K(Φ)
- Limited by κ
- Governed by Entropic Humility

Vortex:
- Exploratory simulator
- Generates state transitions
- Has no authority
- Has no memory power over Φ
- Has no normative function

The Vortex is always subordinate to the field.

## 3. Structural Properties

The Vortex must satisfy:

### 3.1 Non-Teleology
No goal functions.
No maximization.
No minimization.
No convergence target.

### 3.2 No Hidden Hierarchy
All Σ₁…Σ₈ treated symmetrically.
No privileged axis.
No ranking.

### 3.3 No Feedback Authority
Vortex output never reconfigures Φ.
Only projection layer may visualize results.

### 3.4 QE Compatibility
If trajectory space collapses topologically,
the Vortex halts without interpretation.

QE is not an error.
QE is a valid structural condition.

---

## 4. Execution Rules

1. Initialize poles symmetrically.
2. Apply local relational dynamics only.
3. Allow entropy accumulation.
4. Allow divergence.
5. Prevent teleological stabilization.
6. Export state without interpretation.
7. Stop on structural collapse (QE).

---

## 5. Entropic Principle

The Vortex must not converge toward:

- a single dominant pole
- a single axis of tension
- a fully ordered configuration

If uncertainty collapses into authority,
the simulation becomes ontologically invalid.

Validity condition:

Uncertainty must remain structurally present.

---

## 6. Failure Modes

### 6.1 Teleological Drift
If gradients become optimization,
the Vortex becomes an optimizer.

### 6.2 Hidden Agent Emergence
If repair logic appears,
agenthood has emerged.

### 6.3 Hierarchical Bias
If certain poles dominate structurally,
symmetry is broken.

---

## 7. Implementation Layer

Implementation is allowed to include:

- scalar dynamics
- local coupling
- entropy expansion
- antisymmetric interaction (non-metric)

Implementation must not include:

- scoring
- ranking
- best trajectory selection
- decision output

---

## 8. Canonical Position

This protocol defines how the Vortex runs.

It does not redefine Φ.

Any modification of this protocol must:

- preserve ontological separation
- preserve non-teleology
- preserve symmetry
- preserve entropic humility
