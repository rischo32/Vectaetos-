## VECTAETOS — Minimal Meta-Mathematical Specification (MMMC-compatible)

**Status:** Canonical  
**Scope:** Ontology-level (pre-implementation)  
**Normativity:** None  
**Prescriptivity:** None

## 0. Epistemic Anchor

This document is written under the following immutable assumptions:

- Φ is the primary ontological object.
- 4ES + QE are epistemic states, not modules.
- Σ₁…Σ₈ are axiomatic singularities (tensions), not components.
- K(Φ) is a predicate, not an objective.
- κ is a non-numerical ontological boundary.
- Impulse is defined as non-realizability, not action.
- Runes are projections, not operators.
- LLMs act strictly as translators, never as decision-makers.

No redefinitions are allowed beyond this point.

---

## 1. Primary Ontology: The Field Φ

### Definition 1.1 — Field

Let **Φ** denote a cognitive–ontological field.

Φ is:
- not an agent,
- not a system of components,
- not a decision entity,
- not reducible to local states.

Φ exists **only** as a global configuration of relations and tensions.

Formally:
> Φ ≠ Σ(local states)  
> Φ = configuration(tensions)

---

## 2. State Representation

### Definition 2.1 — State Vector

At any deformation index τ, the field is described by: σ(τ) = (E, C, T, M, S)

Where:
- **E** — Energy (capacity for transformation)
- **C** — Coherence (global compatibility)
- **T** — Tension (epistemic strain)
- **M** — Memory (anomalous retention, not archive)
- **S** — Entropy (exhaustion / dispersion)

These are **descriptive dimensions**, not control variables.

---

## 3. Axiomatic Singularities (Σ₁…Σ₈)

Let Σ₁…Σ₈ denote eight invariant tension centers:

INT, LEX, VER, LIB, UNI, REL, WIS, CRE

Properties:
- Σ are not modules.
- Σ do not act.
- Σ do not decide.

They shape Φ by **distorting its topology**, not by exerting force.

---

## 4. Epistemic State Space (4ES + QE)

### Definition 4.1 — Epistemic Mapping

Any proposition p is mapped into:

- **AA** — coherent with human meaning and field
- **AN** — meaningful locally, incoherent globally
- **NA** — incoherent locally, coherent globally
- **NN** — incoherent for both

### Definition 4.2 — QE (Qualitative Epistemic Aporia)

**QE** is an active epistemic state where:
- no transition preserves K(Φ),
- further projection would increase incoherence,
- the system knows *why* it cannot answer.

QE ≠ NN  
QE is **protective**, not empty.

---

## 5. Coherence Predicate K(Φ)

### Definition 5.1 — Coherence

Let **K(Φ)** be a predicate: K(Φ) ∈ {sustainable, non-sustainable}

Properties:
- K is not optimized.
- K is not maximized.
- K is not numeric.

K expresses whether Φ can continue to exist
**without loss of ontological meaning**.

---

## 6. κ — Ontological Boundary

### Definition 6.1 — κ

κ denotes the **non-numerical threshold** of ontological sustainability.

If a transition causes: K(Φ) → non-sustainable

then that transition **cannot exist**.

κ is not enforced.  
κ is **discovered** through collapse of representability.

---

## 7. Impulse (Critical Definition)

### Definition 7.1 — Impulse

An **impulse I** is defined as:

> A locally meaningful tendency that cannot be represented as a global transition of Φ without violating K(Φ).

Therefore:
- impulse ≠ action
- impulse ≠ choice
- impulse ≠ intention

### Consequence

If an impulse would lower K(Φ) below κ:
- it is **not evaluated**,
- it is **not rejected**,
- it **never appears** as a possible transition.

This is the operational core of **Entropic Humility**.

---

## 8. Transitions as Trajectories

### Definition 8.1 — Transition

A transition is not an action but a **trajectory**:  Φ(τ) → Φ(τ + Δτ) 

Valid transitions:
- preserve K(Φ),
- respect all four epistemic states simultaneously,
- do not privilege any Σᵢ.

There are **no actions**, only **allowable deformations**.

---

## 9. Time

### Definition 9.1 — Time

Time is not an axis.

Time is:
- a deformation index,
- a layer of consistency,
- a marker of irreversible configuration change.

Memory M emerges from **anomalous deformation**, not storage.

---

## 10. Runes (Projection Constraint)

Runes are defined strictly as:

> Read-only symbolic projections of Φ after coherence evaluation.

Runes:
- do not act,
- do not decide,
- do not influence Φ.

They are **phenomenological traces**, nothing more.

---

## 11. Role of LLMs

LLMs:
- never access Φ directly,
- never alter Φ,
- never decide transitions.

They translate: Runic Projection → Human Language

LLMs are epistemically downstream and replaceable.

---

## 12. Non-Goals (Explicit)

Vectaetos is **not**:
- an AGI,
- a decision engine,
- a control system,
- an optimizer,
- an ethical judge.

It is an **ontological field formalism**.

---

## 13. Final Constraint

Any implementation, simulation, dialogue system, or visualization:

- MUST conform to this document,
- MUST NOT introduce prescriptive logic,
- MUST treat coherence as ontological, not moral.

---

**End of canonical specification.**
