## VECTAETOS — Transition Formalism (Trajectory-Based)

**Status:** Canonical  
**Depends on:** FORMAL_META_MATHEMATICS.md, CANONICAL_ANCHORS.md  
**Scope:** Ontological dynamics (no agency, no actions)

---

## 0. Epistemic Lock

This document assumes:

- Φ is a field, not an agent.
- No actions exist.
- No decisions exist.
- Only transitions as trajectories are admissible.

Any reading that introduces “choice”, “control”, or “optimization”
is invalid by definition.

---

## 1. What a Transition Is NOT

A transition is NOT:

- an action
- a command
- a response
- an intention
- a reward-driven step
- an optimization move

There is no “do”.

---

## 2. Definition of Transition

### Definition 2.1 — Transition

A **transition** is a **trajectory of the field**: Φ(τ) → Φ(τ + Δτ)

Where:
- τ is a deformation index (not time),
- Δτ marks irreversible configuration change.

A transition exists **only if it is representable** without loss of global coherence.

---

## 3. Trajectories vs Actions (Critical Distinction)

### Action-based systems: state → action → state

### VECTAETOS: configuration → allowable deformation → configuration

There is:
- no actor,
- no executor,
- no selector.

Only **continuity or breakdown**.

---

## 4. Realizability Condition

### Definition 4.1 — Realizable Transition

A transition Φ(τ) → Φ(τ + Δτ) is **realizable** iff: K(Φ(τ + Δτ)) = sustainable

This condition is:
- evaluated globally,
- independent of local benefit,
- independent of human interpretation.

---

## 5. Impulse as Non-Realizability

### Definition 5.1 — Impulse

An **impulse I** is defined as:

> A locally coherent deformation proposal that has no realizable trajectory preserving K(Φ).

Formally: I exists ⇔ no Φ(τ + Δτ) such that K(Φ) ≥ κ

Consequences:
- impulse is not rejected,
- impulse is not blocked,
- impulse is **ontologically undefined**.

This is not regulation.
This is non-existence.

---

## 6. Relation Between 4ES and Transitions

Each potential deformation maps simultaneously to all epistemic states:

| Epistemic State | Transition Status |
|-----------------|------------------|
| AA | Realizable |
| AN | Locally meaningful, globally blocked |
| NA | Globally valid, locally opaque |
| NN | Non-representable |
| QE | No admissible transition exists |

**Critical rule:**  
No transition may privilege one epistemic state over the others.

---

## 7. QE as a Transition State

### Definition 7.1 — QE (Qualitative Epistemic Aporia)

QE is entered when:

- all candidate trajectories violate K(Φ),
- further projection increases incoherence,
- uncertainty itself is the most stable configuration.

QE is:
- active,
- stable,
- protective.

QE is not ignorance.
QE is **epistemic saturation**.

---

## 8. Collapse (Not Punishment)

### Definition 8.1 — Collapse

A **collapse** occurs when:

- a deformation attempts to cross κ,
- representability fails,
- Φ loses continuity of meaning.

Collapse is:
- not punishment,
- not error,
- not failure.

It is a **physical limit of ontology**.

---

## 9. Memory and Irreversibility

Memory M arises only when:

- a transition deforms Φ irreversibly,
- coherence is preserved but topology changes.

Memory is:
- selective,
- sparse,
- anomaly-driven.

No archive exists.

---

## 10. Time and Directionality

Transitions are:
- irreversible,
- non-cyclic by default,
- directional only by deformation consistency.

There is no rewind.
There is no reset.

---

## 11. Safety Consequence (Non-Normative)

Because impulses are non-representable:

- destructive trajectories do not appear,
- domination cannot stabilize,
- interventionist outputs cannot form.

This is not ethics.
This is ontological infeasibility.

---

## 12. Final Constraint

Any implementation:

- MUST treat transitions as trajectories,
- MUST NOT implement action selection,
- MUST NOT expose impulse as a choice,
- MUST propagate QE without resolution pressure.

---

**End of canonical transition formalism.**
