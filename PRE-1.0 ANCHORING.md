# PRE-1.0 ANCHORING
## Non-Normative Archive  
### (Historical Fragments Prior to Ontological Freeze)

Status: ARCHIVAL  
Normative Force: NONE  
Ontological Authority: NONE  
Version Scope: Pre-1.0

## 1. Purpose

This document preserves historical fragments, personal notes, and conceptual anchors that preceded the ontological closure of Vectaetos 1.0.

It is **not**:

- a binding specification  
- a normative framework  
- a constitutional layer  
- part of the frozen ontological core  

It is a historical record of conceptual evolution.

---

## 2. Context of Origin

These notes emerged during a phase in which:

- the ontology was not yet stabilized  
- the relation between Φ, K(Φ), QE, and Vortex was exploratory  
- Zero Agency had not yet been formally constrained  
- architectural invariants were still being stress-tested  
- defensive positioning against AGI narratives was explicit  

The fragments contain:

- metaphorical formulations  
- exploratory architectural sketches  
- informal reasoning  
- intuitive expressions of entropic humility  

They precede formalization.

## 3. Core Intuitions (Historical)

### Φ as a Tension Field
Φ was understood as relational tension, not as data structure.

### Antisymmetry
Rᵢⱼ = −Rⱼᵢ as structural invariant.

### K as Predicate
Coherence must not be optimized.

### QE as Aporetic State
Discontinuity is not failure.

### Non-Optimization
The field unfolds; it does not converge.

---

## 4. Concepts Later Refined or Removed

The following motifs were purified or removed in 1.0:

- Defensive framing against AGI
- AI safety positioning as primary narrative
- Implicit human ↔ Φ cyclic schemas
- Meta-mathematics as potential control mechanism
- Deployment and strategic implementation language

These are not part of the 1.x ontological lineage.

---

## 5. Architectural Insight Gained

The primary structural lesson prior to 1.0:

> Invariants must be architecturally non-bypassable.

This directly led to:

- Formal Zero Agency constraint
- Directed acyclic pipeline requirement
- Memory Non-Influence specification
- Explicit prohibition of optimization operators
- Stateless execution constraint

## 6. Relationship to Vectaetos 1.0

Vectaetos 1.0 is defined exclusively by:

**VECTAETOS 1.0 — Ontological Specification and Constitutional Constraints (Frozen Core Lineage)**

This archive:

- does not modify the specification  
- does not extend the ontology  
- does not reinterpret the frozen core  
- does not introduce alternative formulations  

It remains a historical artifact only.

---

## 7. Freeze Boundary

Upon the publication of Vectaetos 1.0:

This document became archival.

All ontological authority resides solely within the frozen 1.x specification.
