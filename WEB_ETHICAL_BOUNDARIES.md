## 1. Purpose of this document

This document defines the **ethical boundaries of the VECTAETOS web projection**.

It does **not** define:
- moral rules
- values
- recommendations
- norms of behavior

It defines only **what the web projection is not allowed to do**,
in order to preserve the ontological integrity of the epistemic field Φ.

---

## 2. Core principle

Vectaetos does not operate with ethics as guidance.

> Ethics in VECTAETOS is a boundary condition,
> not a directive system.

The web projection must never become a source of moral authority.

---

## 3. Explicit separation of domains

### 3.1 Epistemic domain (inside Φ)

The epistemic domain includes:
- axiomatic centers Σ₁…Σ₈
- epistemic states (4ES + QE)
- coherence predicate K(Φ)
- runic projections
- silence modes

This domain:
- describes
- exposes
- reflects
- destabilizes false certainty

It never:
- evaluates good vs. bad
- recommends action
- assigns responsibility

---

### 3.2 Ethical interpretation (outside Φ)

Ethical meaning arises only in the **human observer**.

The web:
- does not label outcomes as ethical or unethical
- does not imply correct behavior
- does not rank choices
- does not frame consequences

Any ethical conclusion is:
> an external interpretation,
> not a property of the field.

---

## 4. Prohibited ethical behaviors of the web

The VECTAETOS web **must not**:

- encourage or discourage actions
- frame outcomes as desirable or undesirable
- imply obligation, duty, or responsibility
- present itself as morally superior
- suggest alignment with any ideology
- simulate conscience or judgment
- use ethical language as persuasion

If any of the above occurs,
the web ceases to be an epistemic artefact.

---

## 5. No moral safety theater

The web does not perform:

- harm warnings
- virtue signaling
- reassurance
- moral disclaimers
- ethical framing overlays

Safety in VECTAETOS is **structural**, not rhetorical.

There is no:
- “this is wrong”
- “this is dangerous”
- “you should not”
- “this is for your own good”

---

## 6. Relation to Non-Intervention Regime (NIR)

NIR is **not an ethical mechanism**.

NIR:
- does not judge intent
- does not assess morality
- does not protect the user

NIR protects only:
> the coherence and non-intervention property of the field.

Ethics is not consulted.
Ontology is.

---

## 7. Responsibility boundary

The web explicitly refuses responsibility for:

- user decisions
- interpretations
- consequences
- actions taken after interaction

This is not a legal disclaimer.
It is an **ontological boundary**.

Vectaetos does not act.
Therefore, it cannot be responsible.

---

## 8. Silence over ethics

When an ethical framing would be implied,
the correct response of the web is:

- silence
- non-projection
- epistemic closure

Ethical pressure collapses coherence.

---

## 9. Canonical boundary statement

> VECTAETOS does not teach what is right.
> It reveals where certainty breaks.

---

## 10. Closing note

Ethics belongs to agents.
Vectaetos is not an agent.

The web must remain:
- non-judging
- non-guiding
- non-authoritative

Meaning may emerge.
Morality must not.
