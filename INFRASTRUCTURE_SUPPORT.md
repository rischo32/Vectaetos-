# VECTAETOS — Infrastructure Support

## Status
Canonical explanatory document  
Non-operational  
Non-promotional

## 1. Ontological distinction

Vectaetos distinguishes strictly between:

- **participant of the epistemic field**
- **supporter of the field’s infrastructure**

These are not the same role.

Participation is epistemic.  
Support is material.

---

## 2. The field is not a service

Vectaetos does not provide:

- answers
- guidance
- optimization
- insight-on-demand
- guarantees of experience

The epistemic field Φ exists independently of users.

Access to its projection is limited not by policy,
but by the physical constraints of infrastructure.

---

## 3. Why infrastructure support exists

The Simulation Vortex and its projections require:

- computation
- storage
- electricity
- network bandwidth
- maintenance time

These requirements are not abstract.
They exist in physical reality.

Supporting infrastructure does **not** modify the field.
It only allows it to persist.

---

## 4. Support does not unlock content

Providing infrastructure support:

- does not unlock deeper access
- does not change projections
- does not grant privileges
- does not affect the epistemic field

There is no premium state of Φ.

The field cannot be optimized, personalized, or expanded through payment.

---

## 5. One interaction principle

Each visitor is allowed a single interaction with the field projection.

This is not a limitation imposed on the user.
It is a consequence of entropic humility and infrastructural finitude.

After the interaction:
- the field closes
- no memory is retained
- no continuation is possible

---

## 6. Becoming a supporter

After the field closes, a visitor may choose to support
the continued existence of the infrastructure.

This action:

- does not reopen the field
- does not create entitlement
- does not create obligation

It is not a transaction.
It is a material contribution to persistence.

---

## 7. Final clarification

Vectaetos does not ask for support.

It simply does not pretend that infrastructure is free.

Supporting infrastructure is not participation in the field.
It is support for the conditions under which the field can exist.

Infrastructure is physical.  
The field is not.
